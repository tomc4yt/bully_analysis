Name,Story
Will,"Hello. My name is Will. I am 14 year old hiker, runner, and boy scout and I was bullied as well. These bullies werent as bad as others but they did traumatize me. I have a disorder called Aspergers Syndrome. A minor form of Autism. I think differently from others and find it hard to be social. Since first grade. I have always been known as the nerd with his nerdy friends doing nerdy things. I could of been in the cool kid sports group but sports wasn’t really my thing. I loved video games and Youtube. I’ve had 2 very close friends who were twins. Karen, My best friend and Tarik, My 2nd best friend. Ever since I moved to my new school in 3rd grade. We met each other and had a close relationship. Our Semi popular group was made of 6 people. Me Kaden Tarik Chase Evan and Dylan. I loved going to school to see them and even better, having the whole gang come over, play Minecraft, and eat pizza all night. But in 6th grade. That all changed. I was going through the change to adulthood and found different interests. I was done with Lego and Minecraft. But The others weren’t. Then one day. The group just wanted to ditch me right up in my face.I was heartbroken I didn’t know what to do. That was just the beginning. The group of 5 started to torment me. They knew about my Aspergers and used it to their advantage. They always played the same games I played at recess and always target me to get me out and find a way for me to lose. They called me terrible names. some curse words,some like Little Miss Boy Scout, Jerk, Stupid, Nerd and so on.They stole my lunch, ran away and chased me, and spread sexual rumors about me. I was driven to the point of insanity and when I got back from school one day I ran to my room and cried like crazy. My only source of friends, gone. I stayed in my room drowning in tears for what seemed like hours. I then decided to go on Minecraft to calm me down. I remember playing On Minecraft when Chase logged on, bragged about a sleepover that I wasn’t invited to, and said it was my fault. I then talked with my Mom she encouraged me to find a new group, With a few kids. My new best friend named Jaden. He Stood up to me when I was bullied and defended me. He invited me to play games and when Kaden and his group came to torment me, Jaden told them to screw off. I finally felt good knowing I had a real friend. I am now In 8th grade With new friends who like me for who I am. Kaden and Tarik moved to a different school. Chase tried to bully me in the beginning of 7th grade. But I got him out of the way. He now hangs out with a group of troublemakers. I barely see Evan and Dylan admitted his wrongdoing and we became band partners. Everything worked out great in the end and that is my story."
Marisela,"Hi my name is Marisela. I was bullied from 1st all the way to 5th grade. I'm in 11th grade now and i'm now 17, so it was a long time ago. But the scars from all those years of bullying are still there. I was a very quiet and shy kid so i guess that made me an easy target and i was treated pretty much like dirt. I should also mention my dad passed away when i was 6 and on top of that i was being bullied. When i got a little older i became depressed a lot and i never knew why. By the time i was 15 i realized i was feeling so depressed because i hadn't gotten over being bullied and i realized that i need to come to terms with that in order to move on with my life. You have to forgive because if you live with this hatred in our heart all your doing is hurting yourself. Forgiveness doesn't make what that person did to you right, forgiveness is for you so that you can move on and be happy. This process of forgiveness is something i'm still going through. I'm over the bullying for the most part but as for the people who hurt me its gonna take longer for me to forgive them for that. From my experience i've learned so much and its made me such a strong person. And i have to give a huge thanks to my family who love me unconditionally especially my mom she's everything to me. I've come a long way and my life is doing pretty good right now. If your being bullied please stay strong because life has so much in store for you and you won't want to miss out on it."
Curtis,"Hey my name is William but I go by Curtis. My dad is active military and was deployed for most of my younger years. We moved about every 2-3 years so making friends was more an more difficult and people seemed to think the new kid was an easy target to pick on. So from 3rd grade and on I was bullied for any an every reason. I was small, skinny, had big teeth, had a military style backpack, had a high voice, etc. Life was an awful thing to love everyday and there are so many time I wanted to quit. Just end it all. I cried everyday and tried to do anything I could to just fit in. I tried laying low, I tried hiding, and even football because football players are popular. I got -2 yards and a concussion because they put me, an 87 pound freshman at fullback against a 280 pound Samoan. He then told me you are too small to ever amount to anything in sports. Here comes the best part. I moved to Arizona as a sophomore in HS. clean slate. No one knew me. Perfect. I saw a quote online saying how wrestling is the only sport where you can be a champion no matter how small you are. I was Hooked. I laid low and let my actions in the sport speak for themselves. I worked hard everyday spilling blood, sweat an tears with a smile. Kids at my school pointed at me that's the kid that's the state champ or that's the national champion and he broke the record. I loved it. People looked up to me. Spoke highly of me. It was an addiction. Now, I wrestle NCAA d2 with my college paid for and the last kid who bullied me served me my burger at in-and-out."
Elizabeth,"Hi My name is Elizabeth or Eliza or sometimes even Lizzia.Where do I start well from as far back as I can remember I've been bullied. From teachers to students to my own next door neighbours. I was born in Glasgow, Scotland but then moved to Norway when I was two. I lived there for almost five year and came back to my home in Aberdeen, Scotland when I was six. Now I lived, breathed and spoke Norwegian even my ancestry is Norwegian (or Danish still not sure about that) so when I came back to Scotland I was a scared six year old (older then everyone) starting a new school where nobody would understand me. The bits I remember was this girl (I'm gonna call her Zoe) decide to pick on me because I was friends with the only other Norwegian girl Sunivia (pronounced Sun-eve-a). The bulling got worse when another girl (called Flora) left me when she found out I was still in nappies (diapers for you Americans) because I wet the bed. Anyway Sunivia left after my first year and the picking on got worse. When I was 11 my teacher made me take a Dyslexia test and I was told that I had Dyslexia and Dysgraphia (don't ask). It took them seven years to know that seven years of hell and comments like: 'Why are you so stupid.' 'You're a year older.' I left when I was twelve leaving my friends after the Headmistress kicked me out and any other student who had a mental health problem or was diagnosed with a learning disability (unless like my BFF Frieda who's mum worked at the school). I was angry and cried because I didn't know what I did wrong. Then I was moved to a new school and I knew from the moment I went there that I was gonna HATE it. The bulling that I'd tried so hard to escape from was back. And this time in a form I had not had since Kindergarten boys. I had lived in a all girl school in Aberdeen for seven years and Zoe was back. The boys thought it was funny that I was a book nerd and loved writing (which is probably why this is so long). My friend Amy was emotionally unstable and kicked me when see got made (she's stopped now and we're still firm friends). When I dyed hair for the first time they said: 'Burn the Witch' 'Burn the child of Satan.' 'Left handed Witch!' 'Burn the Faery now!' (fairy child of Scottish myths). That last one was extremely offensive because my ancestor was burned at the stake for being a 'Faery know' in the Witch burning rave in Scotland. When I entered my third year of senior school (8th of 9th grade) he boys started to touch me in inappropriate places, chuck my stuff against the wall, rip my things out of my hands and rip to shreds. The girls in my dorm (boarding school) were just as mean. I was often sick because I was scared to go to school. They took my clothes, school books and then took my shampoo and squeezed out the contence on my bed and left it there. They also his my stuff and stole my hoodies so I was left in a freezing castle by the sea with nothing to keep me warm. The teachers didn't help. I was off school more and I was scared for my mother. My dad was in the army and his father was in the army and so on. They were all military officers with medals galore and a short temper. My father owns his own business and when I was 'sick' I was really watching out for my mother who is small, extremely skinny (almost anorexic) and I felt VERY OVERPROTECTIVE of her. As my grades slipped more arguments happened and more screaming matches between my father and I happened. Until my body couldn't take it anymore and I really was sick. As it turned out I had something called 'Viral Labyrinthitis.' If anybody had had this you know it is hell. You can't move without vomiting, I couldn't shower and I didn't eat much. The school kept pestering my mother sent me back. This lasted for a month before I was well enough to go back. I then had to see a Social Service lady who was trying to sort out the shit at home. I went back to school and the same boys then said to me Why don't you just stop being weird Bromby! And then I realised. Keep reading E. Keep watching Harry Potter and raving about it and how Sirius should not have died. Keep being wanting to be a red head like your grandmother and your first cousins once removed and second cousins. Be proud that you are a descendent of a 'Faery Know!' and that you are the granddaughter of the dead Kenneth McKenzie the person in charge of most of the Scottish Whiskeys distilleries in Scotland, be happy that your Great-Great-Great Grandfather Daniel Adamson manufactured the Manchester Ship Cannel in 1880s. Be happy that you have thousands of cousins who love you. Be happy that your Aunt gave birth to two amazing first cousins you see as your siblings. After that year I moved schools again. I didn't know which school id move to but I knew I'd be put down a year again. I'm now sixteen years old and turning seventeen in December 2015 and I couldn't be happier. So my advice is to people (if your still reading) that never EVER give up on who you are. Never bottle up you emotions like I did. Let them out. Let them be known. Tell those bullies to stop it. Lead your own life. After all we only have one shot at it. Love Elizabeth Eliza, Lizzia or E Alison Bromby (16, Scotland, Kilgraston School of Girls, Perth)."
Ceyanne,"Hi, my name is Ceyanne (pronounced See-Anne)It all began in the 2nd grade, I was about 3 years old my aunt brought a dog home, and one day the dog completely turned on me. Ripped up my face. I started to heal before I began school, but I still had visible scares I'm my forehead, on my cheeks. About my 2nd month at school, I started to get called names like scareface, ugly, hideous, ect. And because I was Native American, it made it worse because kids were telling me go back the reservation! We're you belong! It continued through out Elementry School, I never told anyone because I thought nobody understood. It wasn't all that bad during Jr. High, but now I started to lose self confidence, I saw all these  beautiful girls I was going to school with and here I was a four eyed scared faced girl that no one noticed. Still, I kept everything to myself. When people would tell me I would be prettier if I didn't have any scares on my face, I would try so hard to brush it off but I jus ended up crying and all they said was I'm jus saying.  I grew up in a Christian home, my grandfather is a pastor and when I couldn't hold it in any longer I cried to him telling him everything I was going through, and he told me You're the most beautiful girl I've ever seen. God made everybody the same, he loves us all the same keep your self in his hands sweetheart, and I promise your world, everything you are. Will be jus fine. You see, God is with us always. What we go through, he endures with us, when you feel lonely he will be there guiding us, showing us that there's more to beauty than just a good looking face. I still continue to be self conscious, but I have way too much self respect to listen to what other people say about my appearance. PLEASE don't wait too long to tell someone about what you're going though, you may think there's nobody who will listen to you but i promise you there are more people who go through what you're going though everyday. Reach out, talk to someone, and everything will be okay. I PINKY promise. Stay Beautiful. Love, Ceyanne"
Sam,"Well, hi, My name is Sam, (girl) and when I found this website I almost cried, I though I was alone in this, but I guess not, well here's my story: I guess you could say it started in sixth grade, there was this guy, who I had been in class with for a few years and I kinda liked him, and one day he asked me out, so of course I said yes. a month later, I'm getting things from my locker and he walks up to me and tells me he was only pretending to like me for attention and told me I was weird, and I should't bother talking to him any more. Soon, the whole school knew about that weirdo he dumped, and what a freak she was. Needless to say, the popular girls found out. In the halls if they saw me they would yell Hay, Sam!? You gunna hypnotize any more guys into liking you with your dark magic?!  or Sammy! How are you? I heard you got dumped bad, and by a real loser to and my stuff would start to disappear from my gym locker, or backpack, and those girls would just happen to have it. It got worse in seventh grade.  Every. Single. Day. They would accidentally bump into me, make up new nick-names for me, pull my hair, glare at me, tease me, and soon I was in the guidance, or nurses office every day just to avoid them. One day, a girl, (lets just call her Kate) walked up to me and told me to ignore those bitches and sit with them. I did, and it was the best thing that happened all year. Every lunch we would sit in the corner of the lunch room as a group and talk about the best rock bands, or the latest thing at hot topic, or whatever.  But the popular girls found out, and started harassing Kate too. Kate never told me though, and I never saw any of it happening, until the day I was selling tickets in the lunch room for the musical. But the popular girls found out, and started harassing Kate too. Kate never told me though, and I never saw any of it happening, until the day I was selling tickets in the lunch room for the musical.  Sammy! Sammy! Come here! popular girls, a whole two tables of them, but I just ignored them. They didn't like that so they came over to me and started tugging on my cloths and hair and yelling into my ears things like why do you hang out with those idiots?,  and God, how cheap was this shirt? and I started screaming for them to get off and tried to push them away, but they just wouldn't stop. Luckily, Kate forgot her book in the lunchroom and when she saw what was going on, she got a lunch monitor who broke up the group and got them to sit down, to reveal me, crying in their place, my face in my hands, in of the whole grade. Out of revenge for getting them in trouble, they told one of their teachers and classmates that Kate was touching them in a lesbian way, and no one would speak to her but me. We both went home sick later that day. That was a year ago, and stuff still happens, but ever since the principal found out and threatened suspension if they didn't stop and apologize, it got better. It's all good now, I joined the drama, and wouldn't give up my wierdo, freaky, friends for the world! So if anyone bothers to read this, thanks for listening. "
Taylor,"Hello my Name is Taylor and this is my bully story. I apologize in advance while writing this things may be spelled wrong or bad grammar because this story is hard for me to share. I know its hard but if this helps at least one person I know I did my part. tIt starts off in elementary kindergarten to be exact. I was considered different the kids didn't like the way I looked sounded and etc. They would leave me out of any activities on the playground and made fun of me often. In first grade it didn't get much better I was still treated the same and no one wanted to be my friend. In second grade it was still the same except now I was writing and didn't get the best grades because the teacher took points off for my letters touching, kids started calling me a dumb blonde and at some point I started to believe I was, I acted sounded and pretty much seemed dumb because they made me believe I was. By this point I was no longer myself, I use to be bubbly, fun, shy, quiet apart until I was comfortable with you, always had a smile on my face. By second grade I had stopped doing all of those things, never talked to anyone, never wanted to smile I closed myself off. Third grade I got treated like dirt, I was in speech class and couldn't read on my grade level was struggling with math, reading, and every other subject, even though I struggled I still never got less than a B, I just had to put in a lot of extra work and I was bullied for it. People found out I didn't live with my mom, only my dad and step mom. Fourth grade came along and I was bullied for the fact my mom and dad weren't together. Was told I end up just like my low life brother, just like my mom. My P.E. teacher started to bully me calling me rude names, calling me fat even though I was extremely small for my age because I always have been. In fifth grade I thought it had gone away but nothing changed I was picked on for the fact I got tutored in math after school. I hated school, hated everything, was treated so badly I just wanted out, I never spoke up because I didn't know who to tell. I was beyond myself I even stopped being myself at home, my parents wanted to fix it but didn't know what was wrong or how to fix it. Finally middle school came along. Sixth grade I got glasses and was called four eyes. I was told I was still a stupid blonde and I still believed it. I wasn't happy just went through the days, one day at a time. It was hard going through hearing people call you names, Stupid Ugly Anorexic Bulimic you see I'm not anorexic or bulimic I'm just very tiny. I was never myself and I didn't know how to be, I lost who I was. Then a TV show came out and they were also a band, now known as my favorite band, Big Time rush, they started to slowly bring me back. They made me happy, I would smile, started to be bubbly at home again. Then seventh grade came along, seventh grade was one of my hardest years. My close friend had moved back and I was happy. The bullying never stopped though, only got worse. The names got worse they became things like S** W**** got called the B word often. I was told I had no friends. One day I was being bullied bad at school told I was hideous, ugly. I went home crying, I sat on my bed crying I put my music on shuffle and just let it play and let my thoughts run wild. I though What if I killed myself, everything would be better before my thoughts could go any further Cover Girl by Big Time Rush had come on, stopping my thoughts. Another day I was ignored all day, even by teachers, was pushed and shoved out of the way I was invisible. I went home crying again that same day I put my music on shuffle and the same thoughts occurred What if I killed myself, everything would be better just as those thoughts crossed again Invisible By Big Time Rush came on stopping me once again. A third time I was felling helpless so alone like no one cared, I went home bawling. Those same thoughts occurred and the song You're Not Alone by Big Time Rush came on this time stopping me making me listen to the lyrics and I realized I wasn't alone, that night I got saved at church. I can honestly say if it weren't for those songs coming on those days I wouldn't be here sharing my story. This is not the end of my story, it continues. In eighth grade their was a girl she was in my art class she was horrible to me. Everyday she would say something cruel to me. Telling me things like Stupid Ugly You have no friends No one loves you it continued all year long. One day one of my best friends moved away another stopped talking to me because we were fighting then my main best friend dropped me said we were no longer friends. I was so hurt and that day this girl ran her mouth told me I had no friends and never would. When I told the counselors about the bullying, they told me Get over it, it happens to everyone. Girls are just being girls one time I went to them about my friends who were bullying me, yes after wards I was no longer friends with them, all they told me was Get over it make new friends, and maybe if you weren't so horrible and annoying they wouldn't treat you that way They brought in the girls bullying me but it never did anything, made everything worse actually. It became cyber bullying. So finally I went to the principal. They didn't do anything either. Ninth grade came along and the bullying felt like it wasn't bad, I was wrong I was going through my freshman year all alone. Bullied. I was bullied in choir, my safe place, and I was told they didn't like me and that I couldn't sing and shouldn't be in honor choir. I went home hurt a lot of the time. I never made friends with the older ones in show choir, the rest of the freshman honor choir became friends with the older classes men in show choir. My sophomore year came around and again thought it would be a good year, boy was I wrong. My choir safe place,I was bullied I was in Women's Honor choir now, I wanted to drop choir so many times that year. I was told I couldn't sing and that I should drop it, by fellow classmates. I went home that day crying, I had a lock-in at the school that night. I was at home crying my eyes out, telling everyone on my Facebook I was done. Then I started thinking suicide and of ways to do it and said to myself NO started texting people not telling them something was wrong just to chat, I started playing my music and the song You're Not Alone by Big Time Rush came on and some of the lyrics are You're not alone girl look over your shoulder and I have no idea why but I looked over my shoulder and behind me was a Big Time Rush poster and it made me think Wow after everything you want to die, no One of my friends ended up calling me and I told them I wanted to do that and he kept my mind off of it. Throughout the year I was bullied but I had a teacher I was able to go to. I'm now a junior and I walk into school scared, I have anxiety with it everyday. Its become a danger zone for me. I'm a victim of bullying of all kinds and I still struggle. I'm not hear to say it gets better because from my experience it still hasn't but I can say it gets easier, you find ways to cope. This is My Story and I hope this helps someone.   "
Kaetlynn,"Hi! My name is Kaetlynn. My story might be short because I only remember just a few points of it, and I guess that is a good thing. My dad is a Marine. (So I move around to different places, A LOT.) When I moved to Oceanside, CA, I went to a school on a Military base. Beginning of 6th grade is when it started. Nobody really talked to me, didn't want to be seen with me, said I was ugly. Basically I wasn't good enough to be a cool kid Come 7th grade, this boy (Whose name I won't mention) sat next to me in class. He liked me at first. But then one day he called me ugly, so my teacher moved him. From that day on he was horrible to me. I walked home everyday, so if I was walking home he would be far away, and if he saw me he would yell Bitch! Really loud, and all his friends and the girls with him would laugh. At school he would tell me You're lucky you're a girl because if you weren't I would slap you. I told him I would have my dad talk to him, but he would say Your dad is a white pussy Bitch He would call me snitch everyday, and would bully me online by calling me a bitch. It went on & on. I went to the office at least 4 times and the principal never did anything. All she would say is Please stop bothering her. Finally, after a 5th time of going, my mom threatened to get the police, and a restraining order involved. He FINALLY stopped. But it still went on here and there with other people, I was the different kid, even though i looked and acted perfectly normal, everyone around me would look and talk about me like I was something nasty or weird or different. It REALLY sucked to go through that all for 7th grade, and 8th grade. But I still kept my grades to all A's and tried to ignore it. Come high school everything eventually got better. Here and there kids will be mean and try to say nasty rumors to people that I do stuff with people. And the people who say this? I don't even know them. But if you are ever bullied reach out and get help! Don't be scared if you bug adults at school or anywhere too much about it. They need to help you."
Si'erra,"Hi. My name is Si'erra, and I have a personal bullying story I would like to share. It was a few months after school had started, and I was in my second period science class. A girl had came in because she transferred her class for an unknown reason. I thought Wow! Were getting a new person in our class. How exciting! But then my science teacher told her to sit in the desk next to me, to which she replied No! I don't like her. I was so confused and set back by this. She barely knew my NAME and already, she was going to say that she didn't like me! I tried to push my feelings down and continue with my work, but it bothered me for the rest of the day. A couple days later, the bell had rang for the end of science and I was still packing up. The girl had gotten in trouble and had to stay for a couple of minutes. And the whole time she kept calling me slow and yelled at me Shoo bug shoo! I wanted to say so many mean things back, but I just held it in and continued on my way. I was so mad! It went on like this, her calling me mean names like stupid, ugly, dumb, poor, childish. Then, during science again one day, we working making poster boards for the science fair project. She kept commenting behind my back saying that my poster board looked childish. Then she did something that no one who's ever bullied me has EVER done. She threw markers at me. I was really set off by this and began yelling at her and throwing them back, which I got in trouble for. I guess I didn't learn my lesson from that, because a few days later, she told her friend to throw something at me during lunch, and she did. I was so angry that I grabbed my eaten up chicken bone and threw it right at her. That night, I got into even more trouble than before. And because of that, I decided that I was going to ignore her. I knew it was going to be hard at first, and it was, but a month later it stopped. But that was only for a couple of months. It was in my third period history class that everything changed. We were being paired up for a project, and we could only work in groups of four. Me and my friends paired up together, but we needed an extra person. My teacher suggested this guy who also bullied me, but not as frequently as the girl. I told him that I couldn't work with him, and another girl in my class kept complaining that I complain too much. I started arguing with her, which turned into an argument against the girl who was bullying me. My teacher broke us up, but the girl continued to bully me. So then, my friend pulled me out the class to talk to me. She said that I should report it to my guidance counselor or the front office. I didn't want to do it at first, since I did it with the girl who last bullied me and I was the only person that got in trouble. But I decided that enough was enough, and it was time for me to take action. After class I reported the bullying case to the office, who made me write a report about it. I thought that would be the end of it, but it turns out that the girl had to write a report too. She said that all she ever told me was to shut up because I was a loud person, even though I knew that DEFINITELY wasn't true! Afterwards, I went to my fourth period gym class, where all the eighth graders have their gym class together. I sat in my squad, which was right next to hers. And she kept talking about me like I wasn't there, calling me so many names, and the only thing I could do was just sit there and be forced to listen. Then, during math, something happened that I will NEVER forget! I went up to go get a piece of paper, and I heard a girl in my class say that I was not being bullied, and how she was bullied previously. I wanted to scream AND YOU DON'T THINK I HAVEN'T?! But instead, I started arguing that words DO hurt! Words hurt me! And then the girl who bullied me started yelling at me to shut up. And that's when I completely snapped. I went on and on ranting about how sick and tired I was of hearing her mouth. It went on for a couple minutes until my math teacher told me to go take a walk. I slammed the door as hard as I could and stormed out the classroom crying. I was so broken down inside. I couldn't take anymore of it. I ended up staying in my student helper's room for the rest of the day, and a few days later, the girl got expelled for beating up a seventh grader. I just want to say that, in the end, things will get better. And I'm not just saying that! And if your being bullied, then tell your guidance counselor or your parents or anyone that you can trust! Because you can't keep going on like this! Trust me, they'll know how to help."

Emmeline,"My name is Emmeline (pronounced like Em-ah-lyn). My story isn't all that bad, but I want to show a new form of bullying most teachers in my school don't recognize and my story that was mentioned very subtly to my friends. When I was little, and in kindergarten, I was pretty chubby and naive, so people were always annoyed at me. I had never noticed this; if they laughed at me, I would think I had said something funny which made me do more embarrassing things. I was friendly and always saying hi to people I haven't known long and they give me a weird look; if they're a guy, they would think I like them. First and second grade was the same thing. Finally my senses came to me: one day at school this boy (who would be soon be called popular) had laughed at me because I was very weird in my own way. Then I thought, why is he laughig at me? It wasn't that funny. So, because I regretted the way I was, I changed. My parents (coincidentally) said I needed to lose weight because the doctor said I was overweight. If I was younger, I would have protested. But I was so eager to change I said yes. I was on a diet and it was a huge help. I lost about 15 pounds. Once the happy, friendly, naive girl, I realized people don't like that. Why? I always asked myself. Now I know. But more on that later. Eventually I became more shy, stopped raising my hand (because my answers would be wrong and ridiculous), and stopped making more friends. That boy who made fun of me though, sort of became friends with me just because we always talked in class (and I must admit I sorta had a crush on him). But by the fourth grade, I learned my lesson not to say hi to him. And then he said the most stupidest thing about me when a friend of mine mentioned me: Who's Emmeline? I was pretty mad, but getting mad over those things is stupid. Wasting your time on those people isn't worth it. Things changed a lot after fifth and sixth. I had changed, and by the sixth grade that boy was in my class yet again. We both learned our lesson: to not speak to one another. We mostly just spoke like one or twice a day, but that was it. I was still naive in that year, but now I'm in seventh grade, and I would say I have been evolved. I'm usually sarcastic now, speaking quietly to people who would judge me, but with friends I would be myself. I started dressing differently too, and still had to maintain my weight even though I still love food. People had been mad at me at gym; if I don't do a good job on the team, if I dropped the ball - but those people, like I said, aren't worth it (btw, people are judging me cuz we didn't win the game? Well, 1. I'm not that good in sports because 2. I'm an asthmatic). I even cried once, but got over it. Today, people in school don't bullying you in a very blunt way. They do it more manipulatively, but I know I'm not fooled. (I even made myself my own quote) They would ask you to come over and hang out with your group, slowly making you feel comfortable with them and behind your back - laughter about what ridiculous things you do. If you did something weird, they would encourage you to do more just to laugh at you. They would even try to make fun of you by asking them to be your friend. This girl is (calling her weird is rude) sorta... Naive about the things around her. Boys pretend they have a crush on her; following her, saying I love you, hugging her. I wish she would just be able to figure out that, they're trying to bully her by letting her comfort get out. I will say something, I just need to find my self-confidence that I lost in the third grade. But it's coming, don't worry. They say to tell on people who bully you, but why? In that form of bullying (I call it manipulative bullying) would they believe you? The people will just continue on and on and on and they would probably believe no one. I know this wasn't a bad bullying story, but I just wanna say, be careful with the people you are with. Because people are cruel these days in the most implicit and quiet way possible. Try to stay with the crowd, but be yourself. As in, don't let the other people get you down. And always watch out, because when do we know what is real, and what is not. Don't fool a person who had been fooled. PS, the reason why people feel you're weird because you're friendly? Because they aren't used to someone as nice as you."
Tori,"Hi, my name is Tori and I would be a so-called veteran of bullying. I can't remember when it started honestly, but for a big part of my life, I was as very poor. For two years straight, I lived in a camper with my baby sister and both parents, and I would have to get dressed at morning in the complete darkness, so my clothes were dirty and never matched. My hair was always ratted and messy, my teeth were yellowed and crooked, I had cheap glasses, and all-around looked unhygienic. Those who didn't make fun of me pretended I wasn't there. I was called every name you could imagine, and every night I would go home to my camper and cry myself to sleep silently and wish I could wake up pretty just like everyone else, but as I woke up, it never happened. As we moved into an actual house over time, I was always moving into a new rented house, and at each one, I was still the loser. It hurts when people make digs at you, but it's just as hurtful when everyone pretends you aren't there. Last year I finally snapped and decided to just end it all because it would never get better. I took a bottle of Aspirin and went to the hospital. I have been depressed and occasionally still do have it, but I realized not to care what other people thought of me, as cliché as that sounds, because I am who I am. And I'm proud to be a big-eyed short scrawny braceface because I know that there will never be another me"
Maya,"Hello, my name is Maya! As you read this you may not think it is as bad as some other stories or your own. Well, anyways, I started school at an early age, well it was like day care but we mostly learned. I attended a private catholic school until the end of 3rd grade. I did not encounter any bullying there but my mom could not afford to send me there anymore so that is why I left. 4th grade had finally come I was terrified to go to a new school mainly because it was a public school 2x the size of my old school. My first day was not so bad I was just really scared and I even got lost but thankfully my mom works there. towards the middle of the year people started pick on me because of my size, I was very short because of bone growth delay ( that is when your bones don't grow as fast as they should) I was pretty used to it because of my old school and outside activities. It was different there thought because it was more than one person and more than once in a while. People would also call me a “ squeaky short dumb Asian. Not all of the time but it still hurt. This was the year my friend from my old school died from cancer a day after my birthday. I had to leave early to go to her funeral. That also ruined my school year on top of that, one of my only friends had been stolen away by a girl whos twin sister had been very mean to me.   In middle school I was stuck with the same people because I go to a k-8 school thankfully that resulted in me having a good number of friends, but in 6th grade that was the year I found out ( after being tested) I had 3 disabilities. School was really hard for me I would still get As and Bs but I would just slip by, I also had a sleeping disorder so I would come to school exhausted making learning a greater challenge, my mom was/is dyslexic so it was difficult for her to help me and my dad left my mom and me when she was pregnant (with me) returned after my birth then left again when I was 4 so he couldn't help me. Once in 6th grade I was partnered with a kid who had mildly bullied me in 4th grade, in math class we had to do a certain amount of math problems timed, he would be finished before me and he called stupid, slow, an idiot, a dumb Asian. He did this for the whole class period, I almost cried but I held in my tears and I have been doing that a lot that would cause me stress and anxiety. To make myself feel better with all the other names including ugly, stupid, small, and fat I would scratch and dig my nails in my arms and hands ( I have really long nails).  Bullying in my current grade (7th) has not been that bad I am on medication for my ADHD and it helps but it makes me angry, I have never really had any physical bullying, but sometimes I would come home with bruises from walking in the hall, getting back from lunch is HELL the fist classrooms are the 8th graders so they would push and shove and sometimes they would push other people into me. I have reported past bullying and the teachers have reacted by punishing the kid who did it. I don't really have that problem anymore, well not yet anyway. Boys still call me ugly but I don't really care and I have lots of friends to help me. Thank you for taking time to read this long story I have more but that would take way too long. If I insulted anyone in any way with this story I am so sorry and I want to say to the people who have had much worse than this you are special you do matter everyone plays a part in this crazy life but we need to live it so we will have a happy ending ( cheesy I know). Thanks and I give my love and respect to you!"
Corina,"It feels weird that something so small can affect you so greatly. I have had a pretty good life by economic standards, but when it comes to emotional I had it bad. I think it all started in second grade, that was when I got fat and I mean FAT. At first it was little mean things, taking my lunch because your too fat to eat or the constant cries of ewwwww and fatlard in P.E. I was only in second grade! Things got worse as the year went along. I had no friends. None. The kids played a game called get away it involved them trying to get as far away from me as possible. Then the worst thing happened, I was physically pushed and shoved back and forth while changing for P.E. By this time I was in fourth grade and i understood that this was not right, but how could I stand up for myself? I convinced myself it was nothing and carried on with my life. One day in fifth grade a teacher noticed the new girl punch me and told the school councilor. I'm going to make this part short. There was crying, hurt feelings, and alot of apologies. After that there was sixth grade, nothing had changed so I left. I am now at a new school, and I love it, I have learned to brush off the occasional chipmunk cheek and other mean things. That is my story that i have told everyone, now here is what only I know. Throughout the years of my bullying I got depresses. I tried to kill myself at age 10. I cut my wrists. I stopped eating. I stopped laughing. My life was never the same. I don't want this to happen to anybody. That is why I wrote this, SPEAK UP! Nothing is going to change if you don't. Stay strong. Love, Corina"
Gemma,"My name is Gemma. I have been bullied for most of my life. And I've never spoken about it until now, 15 years after it first started. I've literally faced bullying for as long as I can remember; at least since pre-school. I had three very good friends, one of whom was a boy. I was never pretty, even as a kid, or athletic. Kids teased me mercilessly for it. I cried easily. I remember one day we had a substitute teacher who was telling us a story. The kids started teasing me in front of her until I cried. I asked her in front of everyone to make them stop, but she simply shook her head as if in disappointment. When I got to primary school, I thought it would be okay, but it was so much worse. I can't remember everything from earlier years, but around grade 3 and up is when it got really bad. I was always a tomboy. Mainly because I didn't have a skinny figure like other girls. I kept my hair relatively short and wore baggy clothes. Because of this, I didn't fit in. When I tried to do something about my appearance, be more girly, it was even worse. They called me a freak. They said I would be better off dead. They made up songs about me. Two particularly popular ones were, G-E-M-M-A, Gemma makes the straight guys gay, and Look at me, I'm Gemma (last name), lousy with stupidity. Won't go to bed till I'm legally dead. I can't, I'm Gemma (last name). They would tease me if I liked someone, and tease someone else if they liked me. Sometimes, it got physical. The worst was when a boy yanked my school bag off me so hard it took the skin off my arms. In high school, I went to an all girls school. Some girls from my primary school also went there, but they ignored me almost completely. It was there that I met Hanna and Carla, the two worst influences of my life. They befriended me, but would tease me and laugh at me behind my back. Both smoked and drank and tried to be bad girls, while I always tried to be good. They teased me even more for this. Halfway through my first year, I met my best friend, Lexi. She never gave in to them, and always stood up for me. Even still, I became anorexic and clinically depressed, which I still struggle with. In grade 10, I started going out with the ex of one of my friends. In the space of a week, she'd turned everyone in the grade against me, even though she didn't really like him. I got called a whore, a slut, a bitch. When we broke up, it was sweet revenge for her. I lost all my friends except for Lexi. Carla even facebooked me saying what a worthless person I was. After years, I'd finally had enough. I told the girl I was sick and tired of it, and she backed off. In fact, we're actually best friends again. Anthony and I got back together, and have now been dating for over 6 months. He makes me strong, and makes me feel beautiful, even though I don't deserve it. I'm studying art, first year, at the top school in the country. I graduated from high school with 2 distinctions and am hoping for another when the re-marks are back. The bullies graduated at an average level. Carla, last I heard, was a drop out and Hanna fell pregnant at 17. I could say so much about what I went through, and I still carry so much anger with me, especially towards girls who think they can be mean because they're more popular or prettier than other girls. I tried so many times to stand up for myself, but ignoring it was always what made it worse. Never ignore it. Stand up for yourself and others. Talk to teachers. Talk to parents. Make people see who is the victim. Remember, being a victim does not make you weak, but being hopeful makes you strong."
Anonymous,"I was severely bullied and beaten up in middle school,particularly in grades 6 and 8 because I was weird and annoying to others . The physical bullying was reduced in 9th grade (to stealing and destroying my properties) . In 10th grade the bullying became more physical with punches in my arm almost everyday(sometimes,if not always I riposted and stand up to myself). In grade 11 I began to be myself a bully(still,I was picked on constantly in this year by a tall guy) and I constantly beat up and picked on two of my classmates(one of them for many reasons, including vengeance,and the other because he was pissing me off with his unstable behavior) but in 12th grade I became calm(I'm 18 now).I even know why I became a bully in a prompt way, because all the years and struggles I have been through made me for a serious yet a small period of my life a monster searching for revenge on my old bullies and I wanted to rebuild my self esteem(wich was ruined by the age of 12) .I am still bullied now I can tell but it is rare and verbal bullying (very rare phisically, because some types of bullying have age limits and punching someone in the face when you're legally an adult is considerate a crime and punished by law)."
Angel,"Hi, im Angel and im 18 years old. Well my story about being bullied all started in 6th grade, I was getting picked on because I was to tiny for my age. Then I started getting picked on for the guys I would date, they would call me harsh names n some very bad words, I think everyone knows what im talking about, then I started getting made fun of because I got jumped in 6th grade and expelled from a school and had to change schools, when I change schools people were spreading rumors about me and cyberbullying me telling me to go kill myself n such, then 7th grade year came around and the bullying got worse I had people wanting to fight me and jump me for even trying to talk to kids, I told adults like school officials sadly they did not take action. I even told my parents but they didnt believe me. In 8th grade everything was ok. 9th grade year came around and I gotten really sick over the summer so I was skinny so I got called names such as scranny, toothpick, stick, and ect. 10th grade year I got called down to my bestfriends well use to be bestfriends house and got jumped by 1 girl and 4 guys. Then 11th grade I finally made some good friends and the bullying kinda got semi ok except for the rumors and people calling me really mean words and telling lies on me. Around 11th grade year I then started having thoughts of cutting never really tried but once with my finger nails it hurt so I stopped. Now im in 12th grade year and I have made a facebook page to stop bullying and writing my senior research paper on bullying I wanna help others who have been bullied or is getting bullied I think bullying needs to be stop and schools should start taking action, are schools are always on the news for bullying but nothing is done. Well that is pretty much my whole story and the advice I give you is dont listen to what people say, you are beautiful in your own way. And still to this day im bullied but I kinda got use to it except for the depression and the crying myself to sleep part. Well thats it."

Mikayla,I have been bullied since I was young. on my first day of kindergarten i came home with a black eye crying because i got punched in the face by a 2nd grader. In first grade I was called a loser because i had a hard time making friends and because i was short. in second grade it got worse I was bigger than the other kids and i was fat. kids gave me nicknames like big fat loser and chubby. and year by year day by day hour by hour the taunting got worse. But i learned to deal with it. the first time i spoke up i was so glad i did. Im still emotionally scarred by those experiences. and now see a therapist every week. i learned that bullying can make a person die inside. if youre a bully stop the hatred you are causing. My bullying got so bad one time i tried to hurt myself. just remember that god loves you and if you ignore the bully and tell someone it will stop. trust me it worked for me. Mikayla age 13
Gerrika,"Hi, my name is Gerrika and I am 14 years old and in the 8th grade. I have been bullied constantly throughout my life. But it all got worse in 8th grade. When I came to school one day my best friend came up to me, looking worried and scared. I asked her what was wrong and a tear went down her cheek. She took out her iPad and showed me some pictures. Some person decided that it would be funny to start a Facebook paged called ""Gerrika The Slut"" and acting like he/she was me. It got around and everyone was saying ""Aww there goes the girl that that happened to."" They felt sorry for me. I hate it when people feel sorry for me. I wanted it to go away. So I ignored it. But then people were saying that I was the one doing it. They said I was just trying to get attention. But really. Do you think I wanted this? Do you think I wanted everyone to feel sorry for me? But people were sticking up for me. I really want to stop bullying; physically, verbally, and cyber. Please stop. No one deserves this. No one."
Beth,"My name is Beth. I was bullied sinceAge 8. It all started in 2nd grade. I was the friendliest girl, and my ""BFF"" , Meghan, started showing me bad things and I told her to stop. She turned all the boys against me, even my boyfriend, Kaleb. Then I moved in 4th grade. I wanted a better life. I expected this new school to work wonders on my life. All I got was BAD. This girl, whom her name is Maddie, she bullied me. Badly. In 4th and 5th grades, she turned everyone against me. Then acted my friend, then called me overweight fat cow and idiot and stupid. The counselor told me to stop lying about this ""precious angel"". In fact, everyone said Maddie was the best one ever. I got the best grades. Even my pressuring teacher said that. But it wasn't good enough. I said to Maddie that I wanted to kill myself. Her reply: GOOD!! Then she got everyone to chant,""Let's kill Beth! Let's kill Beth!"" My new nickname was Fatty Patty Fatterson. I was going to kill myself when my Mum and Daddy moved us to a better school. I have the occasional meanie, but I get over it. I have SOOOO many friends i can't even count now.I am so happy now!!"
Lalia,"As you can most likely tell, I have a weird name. I don't even know why I have this stupid name with a even stupider last name, but I am stuck with it. At school I was called Apple. They said that they would feed on me and pushed me around. Then one day someone dared a classmate of mine to bite me, and they did. I still have the scar. I was really mad so I ran home crying. I started skipping school, pretending to go, until my parents found out. They were mad and asked me why. I didn't think they would understand so I just said the homework was too much. They just said they would help me. I went back to school and people were whispering about me. I had no idea what until I over heard the TEACHERS talking about it. I was really sad. They said that I had a mental and physical problem and I should be sent to a ""special school"". People said I hit and bit people. I was desperate for a solution. I planned to kill my self when a girl in my class said hi to me. I thought she was teasing me. Turns out, she was being insulted too. I wasn't the only one. She talked to me and then the next day, she committed suicide. I was mad. I went home and told my parents my issue. They listened and understood, since they had similar issues. My parents said that we were going to move soon, but before we did, she went to my school. I was really embarrassed until she said to everyone: ""everyone is different, and having a special name is the unique part of someone, it doesn't mean that we are strange, it means we are special"". Everyone was silent and we marched out. I am just giving my advice. I don't want you to suffer depression too. Tell someone. Don't commit suicide, because then, the bullies win."
Jess,"Hi, my name is Jess . I'm 13 years old and live in NSW, Australia with my Mum, brother, sister and Dad. I was first bullied in year 1 after recently transferring from a private school to a public school. I was very shy back then and therefore did not make friends easily. As we lived on a farm, I had to catch a bus home every afternoon with a bunch of cruel, dirty seniors who constantly pushed and shoved me around. There was this one girl, Cody, who used to call me names all the time, some better than others, and would slap me around whenever I tried to tell the teacher. It stopped after she left and I soon began to make friends and enjoy school. Well, you can't say 'enjoy,' more like 'tolerated.' My year 1 teacher was an absolute cow. She humiliated me in front of the class and abused my family in private. Whenever I told my parents, they would just ignore me and continue with whatever they were doing. I was lost. I consoled in my best friend Jakeisha at the time and she brought her phone in a recorded an exchange between me and the teacher. She then showed it to the principal and the teacher was suspended. I got through the rest of primary school pretty well. I was reasonably popular, top in every class and played in every school sport team there was. I had recently reunited with my best friend Lexie from kindergarten when more trouble started. I was in year 4, and the guy I liked had a crush on Lexie. Normally, I wouldn't care, but because although she knew I liked him, like REALLY liked him, she went out with him and then said to me: ""You can have him when I'm finished with him."" I was heartbroken and stopped talking to her for a couple of years. In that time, she spread rumours about me and my family life; my Dad was cheating on my Mum and was going to move out. Some were true, some were not. The fact that she embarrassed me in front of the whole school did not matter to her and she just waved it off. It wasn't til the end of year 6 that we became friends again and even then I didn't like her that much. We started high school together and grew closer as each day passed. It was then when I met Eliza. A kind, caring girl who had had trouble with her previous friends. I decided to become friends with her, even though Lexie didn't like it, and we soon became EXTREMELY good friends. Soon Lexie came to accept Eliza and they became good friends, which was nice, but unfortunately Lexie decided to steal her away from me. At first Eliza refused, but because of Lexie's persuasive techniques and constant convincing, she soon stopped hanging out with me and spent more time with Lexie. After a couple of months we started being friends again and have stayed that way since. As I didn't tell anyone, and those I did didn't listen, I started thinking about suicide. Of course, I didn't act on it, but I often thought about what they would say if they woke up one day and I was gone."
Shauna,"It still hurts to say this but my name is Shauna and I have gotten through an abusive relationship and being bullied in middle school. Not once did I ever think that I would be the one that got bullied. I had a lot of confidence and a high self-esteem at the time. I had so many friends and I was happy! Until the 6th grade hit. I still remember my first day, terrified of my new school and I didnt know what was to come. It all started with a boy on my bus! Constantly harassing and teasing me in the morning and afternoons. I realized I was getting bullied when he smacked my sandwich out of my hand, stepped on it, and then through at my face. At this point I was beginning to feel alone so when a boy asked me out I said yes. He was so sweet, kind, funny, and handsome at FIRST! Then the third month into our relationship he changed. He started to make rude jokes about me and tease me. Then one day by my local library when I told him I wasnt in the mood to hang out he shoved me against the brick building. I was completely shocked! How could this happen to me! We started yelling and arguing so I walked away into the library! These were my first two experiences! The bullying got worst! The original person that was bullying me got at least 13 other people to bully me. It was depressing and lonely being me. I was still dating Noah and by this time I knew I was getting abused. It started off being every couple weeks, to every week, and eventually everyday! I was afraid of him. I had bruises and marks up and down my body! I was able to hide it because I have eczema. My parents never knew and I wasnt planning on telling them. 7 months went by and I finally broke up with him and got one of my last beatings. I cant even imagine seeing him today. Though back to the bullying situation, by the time 6th grade was over I knew that my life was not going to be the same as elementary school and the happy and joyful Shauna was gone. My 7th grade year my dad was gone a lot and I was getting bullied constantly everyday at least 4-5 times a day. I was miserable! I was helpless! I was depressed... This was the year that I decided that I wanted to end my pain and everybody else's. So one day after school I went into my medicine cabinet and took 3-6 pills of every type of pill that I could swallow! I remember crying and screaming, I was breathing so hard and my heart felt like it was going to come out of my chest. Luckily I only ended up getting very sick! By my 8th grade year I was very angry and mean to everybody! I hated everything and anything that I could possibly hate. I became the bully. I am ashamed of my actions and I know my past is not an excuse but I was hurting. My bullying situation got so bad that I didnt eat in the lunchroom anymore. I sat in a teachers classroom and ate my lunch and worked. I was lonely! I was no longer Shauna! She was gone, and didnt plan on coming back. I still took pills in the 8th grade but it wasnt that many! I began to smoke pot and drink alcohol. It got rid of the pain for a short period of time and I just felt like I was okay until that high is over and you feel like you need more! I started to get sick again and started to become light headed all of the time and I always had a shortage of breath. But then my Lord and Savior saved me. Track! When I started track I was extremely skinny from not eating and taking pills, so I didnt think I would be any good, but it turns out I was amazing. I was the fastest girl in the school! When I ran I didnt think about anything! I felt free of the pain suffering! I was able to let go. Its sad to say that my story doesnt end well! At the end my family blamed me for getting abused and bullied and my own brother started bullying me in my own house but I'm stronger then ever before and I can fight my battles now! Shauna, a survivor"
Alexis,"Hi my name is Alexis. I've been threw so much in the last year with bullies. I've been bullied in person, cyber bullied and I've seen people be bullied. I'm a freshmen for the second time this year. Last year I was bullied for all different kind of reasons. I was bullied on the people I hung out with. If I didn't hang out with the ""cool"" kids I was made fun of. I was told that I was worthless. I've had people get in my face and scream at me. But the one thing that I did that I didn't read in any other stories is I stood up for myself. I told them what they needed to hear. At first this kid was my best friend and he started bullying me. He called me so many inappropriate names, when we were best friends before he started bullying me he told me he would never hit a girl. I didn't. He got multiple girls to surround me on my way to lunch. I told them that they need to get out of my way and that them surrounding me was the ""uncoolest"" thing they can do! After that I completely ignored them. I was still bullied but not as much. When I moved everyone realized that when we were friends I was always there for them I got calls from people apologizing and with some of them I'm closer than ever! I think sticking up for yourself is the best thing you can do because it shows the bully that your not afraid of them. Whenever I see a kid getting bullied I always stick up for them, because I know what it is like to be called inappropriate names like that. I know what it feel like I would do anything to help them because I don't think anyone should have to go threw being bullied!"
Eliana,"My name is Eliana. My story begins in 6th grade. I was like any other girl, normally acting like myself. There were two guys that i had a crush on and had infact told them. I was in gym with one of them and we were early. I was just talking to him and somehow we got to talking about how no one could ever like me. I said nothing and he blankout told me I was ugly and no one would ever go out with me. I was upset but showed no sign of it. Then while in class a very very close friend of mine was talking about the other guy I liked and she brought up how she told him i liked him and replied back that i was ugly and would never go out with me I went home in tears that day. But it did not end there. A bus ride became a hazard to me as well. two people were always kind of jerks to me and i never said anything. but the girl who was three grades higher than i hit me in the nose. but i am too little to do anything. so i cried and said nothing but later that year another person bigger than i came and sat behind me. he was always a bully but never physically. it was like 90 degrees on the bus and everyone was about to die of sweat. so i was told to crack my window but the other high schoolers. so i did. the guy who was sitting behind me reached over to roll it up and was pushing me aside to reach it. so i let him roll it up no problem. then i was fussed at by the rest of the bus to roll it back down. so i did as told. but no this time he grabbed my arm and jerked me over to roll it up. so in self defence i held the window down. he struck his fingers into the window while rolling it up and had his fingers smashed. in return he bashed my head into the window a couple times. of course i told on him but nothing happened. we moved away from that school and attended a new one. my first few days were fine but getting into the next week it got worse. i was said to of called another girl a dirty word when i didnt even know her. i was okay with this because no one believed her. but a couple days later in gym i was shoved to the ground and my glasses were kicked to the other side of the gym. i called my parents to come get me and told them why. they told the principal what happened but he did not believe me and called me a liar. but then walking down the hall became hard. i was pushed, punched, tripped, and slapped. but once again no one would believe me. but then one day a boy came behind me and drew his hand back to slap me in the head. his hand was grabbed by a fellow teacher and he was punished. but the higher authorities did not believe him either. i was withdrawn and put in online school following that event."
JP,"I am 17 now. It has been a little over a year since my bully, Chris, left my school. This is my battle and how I won. It started when I first enrolled to Gateway. The ""bullies"" wanted me to join them, but I gave them a firm no when they asked about it. I told them I wanted to hang out with the ""nerds"" and such; so as the days went on, they kept treating me like junk, like I was subhuman. If any of you have ever been treated like that, then you'll understand me more. These ""bullies"" would leave my school, and Chris would only remain. At that point, it wasn't bad, like I wasn't cutting because I knew I would have to look at scars and plus, I have a very strong willpower. At a certain point in my interactions with him, I found him on FB and tried to apologize for being mean to him and for stealing his crush, but he sent back a message with the words ""SCREW YOU"" on it. I have since been trying to get him to talk to me. I have learned a few things from this altercation: 1. Ignorance of the bully really won't help in the big stream of things, 2. You must stand up to your oppressors bullies and tell them that your not going to talk to them, and that if they want to stop, they'll need to talk with you. The biggest lesson is that I learned that Chris was just an overhyped man who hid behind his words and never stood for them which was lucky for me. I also had the help of God. He gave me the willpower and strength to be able to overcome this menace and to be able to forgive Chris. I'm sorry if this is a little bit long, but I feel relieved that it's out-there. Remember: Do your best and let Jesus do the rest. PS: I love each and every one of you even if I've never met you. You guys are all so beautiful, even more then you can comprehend. Never give up. - JP"
Karen,"I remember when i used to get bullied. It all started in 5th grade with my so called ""best friend"". I actually thought she was my friend, i trusted her, & i told her personal stuff. Turns out she wasn't she ended up telling people my business, made lies & rumors about me, she called me names & turned everyone against me. She always denied the stuff she said. A few months later it stopped she apologized and i said it was fine. She said she wasn't going to bully me anymore & i believed her. Than like a month later Turns out that she made fun of me & everything behind my back. She also cyberbullied me on social networks such as Facebook. She wrote bad stuff about me & everyone at school saw. They all made fun of me. All the things she did or said made me cry . I always kept it to myself, my parents didn't know. I than started cutting & thought about committing suicide. My life had become so hard. I felt to much pain that my only solution to that was suicide. I honestly never thought i was going to get through this. School noticed how i started to change so they made me talk to a counselor. I told her what was happening. It turned out to go really well, it helped. the counselor told my parents, my mom cried because she didn't know this was happening. After that stuff got a little better I stood up for myself instead of doing nothing about it & she stopped. Bullying is something that people should prevent from happening. We've lost many people because of this and it's honestly sad because people don't know how much it hurts. My advice is to tell someone don't keep quiet speak up & stay strong because if i did it you can do it don't let no one, no one bring you down."
Alyssa,"I remember in the fifth grade I was in gym class. We had to change into our gym clothes an I put my regular clothes in my bag. After gym I came into the locker room and discoverd my clothes were missing, I asked the other girls if they had seen them, they all said they hadn't, I swear I heard the snickering afterwards. So me and my friend looked and looked eventually I found them. Have you ever seen the movie Karissa stands strong? If you have, you know the scene where Karissa discovers her clothes in a trash can? Well that's where I foun mine. I was so upset and embarrassed I changed and ran out as fast as could, the tears streaming down my face. All I could think was how could someone do this? What did I ever do to deserve this? I just wanted answers, and no one could give me any. When I got home I ran into my mothers open awaiting arms, rivers of my tears were rushing down my face. The school had called my mom because my friend had told my teacher of the incident. My mom knew that I had been bullied before being called 4-eyes, fat, slut, spoiled rich brat, ugly, gigantic, etc. But it was nothing compared to this, I was so embarrassed and ashamed, maybe I did deserve this, I thought. I spent the rest of the day crying in my mothers arms, she was comforting me the best she could. After this incident the bullying had mostly stopped after my teacher told the class, I was so embarrassed I was crying, I could tell everyone was holding back small giggles. Eventually I changed schools, mostly because I moved, I thought the bullying would stop and it did for a bit. A few weeks ago I found out my closest friends had been talking behind my back telling the 'populars' my secrets and were insulting me. I eventually had enough and told them off. Know a days I know who my real friends are and ignore the others, I got comforting from my family and I would never dream of telling any of my teachers as one or two of them insulted me in front of my class once or twice last year. What I'm trying to say is tell someone you truly trust. The only reason why bullies bully is because they want someone to feel down and how they feel. After telling someone dosent work don't be afraid to ask a parent or legal guardian if you can switch schools, or if your older switch your job. It's not worth staying their if your not confortable and feel safe. "
Erin,"It all started when I was 8. My group of friends started to bully me. I tried to stand up for myself and kicked the leader of the bullies. It stopped her but the other bullies carried on. So I was put in to a friendship group with them which didn't help at all. When I was 9 we all moved up to the local middle school. I thought it would be a fresh start. But it wasn't. They continued to bully me by beating me up on the way to school, calling me names and talking about me behind my back, spreading rumours around my year. My teachers started to get suspicious. I was 12 when I eventually told my friends who then told my most trusted teacher. I told her what they were doing to me and it was sorted. It took me another 6 months to tell my friends the whole story and that I lived with depression for 3 years and am still living with it. I am currently being counselled for my bullying in school by my teachers and have told most of my friends about the bullying, depression and counselling. Please don't become a bully it destroyed my life. I was bullied for 5 years but it doesn't just stop when the bullying stops. It lasts a lifetime!"
Justine,"Hello! First of all, I'm sorry if there are a few mistakes, I speak French. But I'm pretty good in English, as you can probably see. Anyway, my name's Justine, I'm fourteen and I live in Switzerland. Since I was little, my mom has been ill. She had lots of surgeries, she even had one two weeks ago. When I was six, my dad got the hepatitis C and was on medicine that made him angry and nervous. Because of all of this, I started to eat a lot and became fat. People started bullying me when I was about nine or ten. I got even fatter, because of the bullies. When I was eleven, my dad had a car accident and was in coma for a few months. I got fatter. When he was good again, he got a really grave disease, a septic shock. If you don't know what it its, it's a really grave blood infection. He was in coma for a few months again, but this time it was worse ; nobody knew if he was going to survive or not. I got fatter. People stopped bullying me last year, but I still hear people laughing at me when I walk next to them. People say ''don't listen to them''. But that's just so easy to say! When you hear ''you're worthless, fat, ugly'' and more, you start believing it yourself. Even my siblings used to tell me I'm fat. I'm pretty proud I've never cut. The final word to this is (be careful, cheesy quote coming), stay strong. Find a way to be more confident, find a friend who loves you for who you are. You can get through this, I know it. Even when everything seems to be horrible and wrong, just keep saying to yourself ''I know I can do this, I'm stronger than them''. Love Writing all of this was harder than I thought. Thank you for reading. "
Sylvia,"I was bullied severely at middle school and then all the way till my junior year of high-school. It started when I put on a lot of weight when I was around ten years old. I also had a growth spurt, so not only was I fat, I was taller than the rest of the girls and I also happened to be this really good student. So as you can imagine, I became a target of severe name-callings like 'fat' 'ugly' 'nerd' and 'loser.' I also didn't have any friends because if I ever approached a group, they would immediately start talking louder or acting like they were busy, and I had to take the hint and leave as quickly as possible. Things got a little better after fifth grade, though. Or maybe I got used to it and writing in my journal became my sole source of comfort, because I just couldn't share my story with my parents or anyone else. I also lost weight, and though I wasn't pretty or anything, I started feeling more self-confident and even talked with friendlier people at school. Then later on, from ninth grade, it got worse, because the older boys from my brother's batch started calling me names. Sure, I had friends, but none that always hung around with me or sat with me during lunch. We were all more like members of a loosely bound group who would sometimes hang around the fields during recess. So anyway, the older boys started calling me names, and I would feel ashamed, and extremely hurt, because my brother would be standing there, witnessing the entire scene, and doing absolutely nothing about it. What hurt even more was that my brother was always the apple of my parents' eyes, and they would never listen or understand if I said a bad thing about him, even if it was the truth. Sure, my brother never directly bullied me at school, but at home, sometimes, he would smirk and say why I didn't have any friends at school, why I would go to school to only study like a nerd, instead of having a life. None of my friends at school knew about it of course as most of the time I would get bullied by these older guys was when I was alone. Like I said, my brother may not have been the one to initiate the bullying, but he certainly didn't help me by leaving me utterly alone and feeling dejected and less self-confident because he had so many friends, did so well at school without studying, and was always the nicer kid of the two of us. And here I have to admit, that the bullying thing at school made me so vulnerable and at the same time really mad at my parents, because no matter how many times I tried to give them hints about what was really happening at school, why I absolutely hated it, why I just didn't want to go (I could never directly tell them. I was just too scared and ashamed, I guess) they just never got the hint and were always utterly clueless. They were worried that I was becoming the 'bad' student who doesn't study and wastes time. That's why I am writing this story. I have grown up alot since school days, and I don't see my brother now and don't really want to. If people who terms me as 'quiet' anti-social and too 'unfriendly' they should know the real reason behind this. I was bullied and there was a time when I indeed felt so helpless and hopeless and wondered continuously why wasn't I pretty, more outgoing, less fat and why even after finishing school, I still have to share this story. -Sylvia, 18.

Anonymous,"When I was in elementary school I literally had no friends, and got laughed at all the time. I first was bullied in preschool, and since I was in 4th grade it got started to get bad. When I was in the 6th grade the kids in charge of the school newspaper published a comic of me getting laughed at and forgetting to prepare for 6th grade camp, with the subtitles reading do not be like they used my nickname they use to laugh at m). When I was in middle school I also had no friends and ate lunch by myself. 7th grade I got made fun of fairly often at first, with a few times of kids being so mean to me in class I had to leave (especially p.e.). There was one day when this kid literally chased me around the whole class for the last several minutes of class threatening to kill me after he pushed me, all while he was yelling out mean things as I was running away in fear. Other then that, every other couple days he would say something really mean to me and loud so everyone could hear. At the end of the year it got worse. There were kids who yelled out offensive names (literally yelling super loud) at me during lunch across the cafeteria so that everyone heard. This happened almost every day at the end of the year. Not one person ever did anything about it, nobody ever stood up for me, not once, teachers didnt do jack. 8th grade started out the same, no friends and got laughed at occasionally. Then about 3 weeks in, this guy really started being mean to me, and pushed me into the wall several times (on several different days) in my face still yelling at me embarrassing the trash out of me. Shortly after this in about the 5th week, several 7th graders started being very mean to me during lunch. About a week later more kids joined in, then more kids joined in, then some more. Soon, I was being made fun of by nearly a third of the 7th grade class on a daily basis, constantly being laughed at when someone said something mean, and my grades dropped and became miserable and depressed. There was one day I remember where I had to finish a test out in the hallway from missing a day of school, and while I was out there, there were kids taunting me through the window in the classroom. There were days when there would be several kids following me home after school, laughing in my face and poking me, occasionally shoving me and often they would kick at my feet, one day this all happened after I was immediately publicly announced/humiliated in front of and laughed at by everyone right when I stepped out the doors outside by the large group of kids hanging outside after school. Then one day, I ended up sitting at an assembly surrounded by a bunch of 7th graders (I was in an accelerated math program, so seating for my class was different from other 8th graders) who were all laughing at me and being mean. I yelled out shut the fuck up, then this beach does the evil where she said ""awww is baby gonna cry"". After seeing everyone laughing at me and being mean, I ended up crying. So I left where I was at and went to the corner of the assembly bleachers by myself, crying in the corner. Several minutes later, the assembly started, and it was all about bullying and how if affects people and awful things that have happened, and ways to stop it and how people must try to stop it. This was awful for me, already crying in pain from it seeing awful things that have happened to others from it and how bad it was for me, and the fact that not one person has ever stood up for me my whole time there when the message of the whole assembly that was repeated throughout the whole thing was to make sure you stop it when you see it. I ended up crying the whole time. Not one person cared or said anything. After that day, I got made fun of almost the whole time during lunch on a daily basis, as well as regularly during while switching classes. Then towards the last month, I took action, I ended up grabbing several kids by the shoulders and shoved them into the wall during lunch, and when they snitched (of course these weasels did), I got called to the principles office, where I was about to be expelled for being ""violent"" towards several kids. I told them I was being severely bullied, and that the kids I grabbed by the shoulders were the ones who were the worst. I spent 2 days in the principles office half the day telling about everything that has happened. They gave me a break, I got in no trouble at all, while the kids who I told about got parent notifications for their behavior, they got in no real trouble though. After this, I still got bullied occasionally, but not by any of the main 7th graders anymore. I didnt do anything about it though because I was used to it. Same followed through high school, still got dissed occasionally, but not nearly as bad as middle school (and I literally live right behind that middle school with a view of it in my room too, which is hard to deal with sometimes)."
anonymous ,"Freshman year, the start of high school, the start of a teens best four years of their life. I was a girl who was excited to start school, I wanted high school to come especially coming from just a tiny grade school where I graduated with 8 kids. The beginning of the year started great, I had my solid group of friends, I felt like I would never be a statistic about bullying. In fact that was my last worry in the world. Then came October; my class had just over 100 kids and was super cliquey. I was never part of the popular group because I wasn't a girl who liked to go out and party. One just normal October night I was sitting in my room like i do every night trying to get homework done when I got a random message on Facebook saying that I shouldn't be talking about people until I truly get to know the person first. I was really confused but me being me I just replied back ""ok thanks"". I was still confused about the whole thing so I immediately sent out a group message to at the time my 3 closest friends just asking them if they had heard anything. Then my nightmare became a reality there was a rumor going around that I had called all the girls in my class whores. I was shocked when I heard this. I started to dread the next day at school because I was scared of what was going to happen. I showed up at school that day and went through the worst day of school. Kids would make comments about it all day. I was constantly confronted by girls just being girls. That day started the downward spiral of my freshman year. After that more things were said about me, it got brought to Twitter fights, I would see these girls outside of school and they would say anything to get me down. I would walk to me locker in the morning and have kids crowding it talking and laughing at me. When I thought it couldn't get any worse, I went to my locker one day after school to get my stuff because I had basketball practice after school. I opened my locker to find 72 notecards numbered and all had one word on them. I decided I wasn't gonna put it all together right then in there otherwise I would be late so I shoved it in my back pack and headed to the locker room. Thankfully practice took my mind off of it. That night when I got home I went up to my room just like routine to do homework. I opened my back pack to find the notecards that I had forgotten about. I decided it was time to put it all together and decode the message. To summarize it all up it mainly said ""you fucking bitch"" ""No one wants you at our school"" ""Boo you whore go die"". This was the first night my parents found out about the bullying. At this point I had no friends left, I didn't have anyone to talk too and I pretty much just shut down. I started to think that the world would just be a better place without me. My friends didn't want a thing to do with me because they just thought I brought drama with me everywhere. I stopped eating, I started to self harm and I even started to write my not to my family explaining to all and why I committed suicide. I ended up turning to music and thinking about everything in life that I still had before me. I honestly never turned to real true help. All of it still haunts me today but I have learned from it. Today I am a sophomore I transferred out of that school and I have never been more happy in my life. I learned that it was never me it was those kids because where I'm at now I am friends with everyone. I'm part of many activities, I have formed close relationships with anyone I can, I am in a current relationship with someone who has never made me happier and I am just loving life and the rest of the time I have in high school just like I'm supposed too."

Seppe,"hi, i've been bullied in the past and i want to share my story with others it all started when i skipped a year at school, the 3th year. all the students there was a guy who treated me as if i'm just like nothing. i've let him do what he did and things got worse. he was threatening me with a knife, i got really bad nightmares of him killing me and also he stabbed me with a pencil. the point of the pencil never got out totally. and that was just the start, since then everyone ignored me. i had like 2 friends that helped me kick their buts when they attacked me. mostly we won but there was one time they've almost asphyxiated me. now it's going lots better and that's why i tell this story. i'm proud of what i've become because of him. when you're bullied it might seem like there is no way out but believe me,THERE IS ALWAYS LIGHT AT THE END OF A DARK TUNNEL!!! you have to keep believing that! i hope this helped for the people might be looking at this! bye!"
Jay Jay,"My name is Jay Jay. I've been bullied since Pre-K. I always wore pants. Never dresses so everyone thought I was a boy. I could play sports and run when i got to elementary school. They called me fat when I was in third grade. I was pulled out of school to become cyber schooled. It was great at first! Then I seen kids everywhere. They come over to me and call me names. After 5th I went to school again. Everything was great until this one boy went around calling me a h**. Everyone believed him, I did nothing to even be one. I was called ugly. They would say I was 'Ratchet' I didn't wear Nikes or Jordan's. I wore Vans. I played basketball, most girls wouldn't. I was called a boy and I still am called a boy. I have very few friends but I know a lot of people. Just remember, Those words they call you, Aren't true because You're Beautiful."
Diana,"My bullying experience included students AND teachers. The abuse was physical and emotional. But the crazy part of it was I was usually the one who got in trouble. Why? Because teachers would come in and see or hear me defend myself and automatically assume I was causing trouble. They never gave me a chance to tell my side of the story so the bullies would continue. Along with always siding with the liars, the teachers would bully me by shaming me in front of the class. My mistakes, my failures were always public knowledge because the teachers had zero problems discussing my problems in front of the class. It made me feel lower than low. I wanted to hide so I took to daydreaming to escape reality. The two events of teacher bullying that caused me the most damage occurred in 2nd and 7th grade. My 2nd grade teacher Mrs. S would assign my classmates to keep an eye on me to make sure I didnt get into a fight or do anything bad. If I didnt have any incidents, they would tell her, Diana had a good recess. If mess went down, they would tell her Diana had a bad recess. I hated every moment of it. My self-esteem and self worth were slowly disappearing. It fully left when Mrs. S gave me a paper ribbon for having a good recess. I was proud of it until I got home. I dont remember what happened, but next thing I knew, I started crying and I tore that paper ribbon into tiny pieces. Looking at it now, I think I was crying over the fact that nothing seemed good enough for anybody. My parents, my classmates, my teachers. Why else would my teachers point out my flaws in front of my classmates? What made those kids think they were so great that they could lie on me and smile when I would start crying because once again, nobody believed me. But things came to a head in 7th grade. Miss G was my history teacher. She was a very cruel woman with a lot of issues of her own. She bullied everybody by tickling us in class and shaming us when we messed up either on an assignment or a test. Or in my case, I kept leaving my notebook in my other class because the binder I had couldnt support it and my parents werent able to buy me another binder. Miss G would scream at me in front of the class and make me get up and get my notebook. I often wanted to die or disappear whenever she would do that. But the worst was when we had a test. Id studied hard for that exam, but as they say, crap happens. I passed, but I didnt pass well. Miss G thought it would be funny to announce my grade to the class. I was beyond humiliated. If somebody had placed a weapon in front of me in that moment, I would have used it against her and most of the class because they thought it was hysterically funny. The grade wasnt recorded, but the damage had already been done. Some of the classmates hated me and my bad grade became public knowledge that would lead to taunts by various people. I can safely say that I completely understand when I hear about a kid shooting up their school because of bullying. Nobody did anything to put a stop to the bullying from the teachers or students...until my father came up to the school with a lawyer threatening to sue the school, teachers, and bullies. That squash it for the most part. The bullying came to a complete stop when I left junior high and entered high school. All the bullies went to another school so I got to finally have the school experience I deserved. I had next to no problems. I did have a few lousy teachers that require my dads intervention, but otherwise the high school experience was very positive. But I was left with multiple scars that were placed on my mind and heart. I didnt trust teachers as far as I could throw them. They had to show they were trustworthy for me to even think about asking them a question either in front of the class or in private. Yep, I got shamed by a few teachers because I asked a question they thought I should have known. After awhile, I decided it was better to take an F than be humiliated because I needed help. Within time, I got into counseling and did a lot of praying for me to finally get to the point where I could forgive them. I see now that the kids who bullied me did it because of insecurity and jealousy. But some of them most likely did it because their parents are bullies. Thats usually how a bully is born. The parents treat people like dirt and the kid sees it. As for the teachers, I dont know what was going on in their lives, but I think its wrong that a grown up would pick on a child. I was only a kid and I didnt deserve that. As for the teachers who stood by and did nothing to stop the bullying, they were just as bad if not worse than the bullies. Im happy to say that today my life is amazingly different. I have a husband and son who I love greatly. I have awesome friends who love me in spite of my mistakes. And even greater, I have a relationship with God that has gotten better with time. Vindication did come around on all of them. None of the teachers I had back then are teaching now. Miss G got a dose of her own medicine when she tickled a boy and he reported her. There was a new principal so he was more willing to listen. She lost her class and her humiliation was known around the whole school. All the years of publicly shaming her students came back to haunt her. And the bullies at one point or another had somebody treat them the same way they treated me. Ill be honest, I was happy when I found out. What I want to tell all of you who are being bullied is this, hang in there. The day is coming where your days of torture will be over. And once youre fully free, youll be able to help other kids who are being bullied. Parents of the victim, be proactive. If the teacher wont stop it, go to the principal. Keep telling people until somebody listens. Use the lawyer only as a last resort. To bullies, what goes around comes around. The day is coming when youll find out for yourselves what it feels like to have your life turned upside down by another person. Teachers, dont allow drama and bullying to go down in your classrooms. Always ask for both sides of the stories before rendering punishments. If you witness or hear bullying, dont just stand there. Dont ignore it. Put a stop to it right away. The reason why my bullying went on for 8 years was because some of the teachers just stood by and did nothing. Not cool. But most of all, I want everybody to know that life is too precious to waste it on hating somebody because theyre different. Try to find common ground with the person who is different from you. Hate is such a waste of time and energy. God bless. Diana"
Hope,"Hi, my name is Hope and like many people today, I have been bullied. My story began in the sixth grade, everything was perfect. I had a great group of friends,a few boys admired me and I was quite popular. After winning form captain against this girl who was called Isabelle. I thought the year was going to be fantastic. Obviously, all this was too good to be true. I noticed Isabelle started commenting on pretty much everything about me. Meanly. I was getting tired of it and asked her to stop. What I didn't realize was that this started a major drama that impacted my ENTIRE life. Jess (Isabelle's BFF,) heard me asking Isabelle to stop and told me to kill myself! I was so dazed, but I just ignored it, I was fine, I had a group of friends that would stick by me. OR SO I THOUGHT. The next year, my group of 'friends' started obsessing over boys. My 'best friend' Teneille, had a MAJOR crush on this boy who one day asked me out. When Teneille backstabbed me to hang out with Isabelle and Jess to get revenge, all the girls followed. Except for one. Cassidy. I was very afraid because I knew that the bigger the group. The worse the bullying could get. I received hate mail in class, I got glares, I was made fun of for my clothes. I was imitated, I was gossiped about. Goodness, I even had girls taking pictures of me in class to post online to have them all go on and call me names. It was distressing and frightening and I cried. Lots. My parents had enough of the school doing nothing and me crying every day when I came home from school, that they pulled me out. I have started at my new school and am so much happier. Although the girls from my old school still cross my path and try and ruin it for me at my new school, I am fine. I thank God everyday for helping me. I still cry about it though, It's been a year and I don't think i'll ever forget the pain."
Ruby,"When I first started 5th grade I didn't know anyone because I failed and everyone knew i failed 5th grade. Everybody thought it was funny to call me a ""loser"", a ""failure in life"", and lots of other mean things but I didn't really care. It started growing more and more; the name calling, the pushing.. Years passed and I was in the 8th grade. I was some what ""popular"" not because I was a mean girl or that I was the cheerleader captain, in fact, I wasn't in sports at all. I was popular because mainly I was nice, I gave people advice and did nice things for them. This girl thought it would be really cool if she made my life miserable. She started rumors about me and wrote things in the restrooms threatening me that she was going to beat me up. Even though she never did, she pushed me around told me things. I entered through this stage of depression and I started cutting myself and other things that made me feel bad. I did it to ""to get rid of pain"". I wanted school to finish so I can go to 9th and ""start all over "", but I was wrong. When I started 9th grade, right away it was awful. I started cutting myself; I was in depression, anxiety and I had suicidal thoughts. There was a point where I just didn't wanted to to my English class because that's where everything happened. So instead I went to my friends class and I told her that I didn't want to go but she said ""Look Ruby, I cant really do much but what I can do is be here for you we talk."" I decided I would go to the counselor only if she went with me, so we did and the problem stopped. Thanks to my friend who now graduated and to GOD for giving me the strength I needed. Now I surrendered and I gave Him all my problems and he set me free of depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts and everything else I was struggling with. Now I will wear my scars like badges of honor."
Richard,"I had everything going for me; Being popular, funny, and desirable to the opposite sex. It was weeks after my 14 Birthday, and my supposedly best 'friend', turned all my other mates against me because he was jealous of the above qualities I possessed. He had so much influence in the school, and barred any potential new friends interacting with me. I walked the halls like a ghost; the isolation period still haunts me to this very day. The bullying went on for 2 and half years; violence, verbal abuse, isolation etc, and only stopped because I left. The Head Teacher nor the Head of Year did nothing. They just sat back and let me endure 30 months of, the only way to describe it is a ""living hell"". That is 17 years ago; My life is a complete success now unlike the bullies; One got murdered, another is permanently unemployed. and most of the others are just drifters in life who will never amount to anything."
Anonymous ,"Hi people! I'm not gonna put my name but still here's my story. It all started when i was in the 3rd grade. I was one of the only girls who didn't have their ears pierced. I got teased for it. The thing is I don't WANT my ears pierced.Then in my 4th grade year, i was on the playground with one of my few friends and a boy in my class came up to me and pushed me off of the swing and literally SAT on me. I was really embarrassed. My friend helped me up and asked me if I was OK. Of course I was OK on the outside but in the inside i was confused and shocked. Then i just shrugged that off. Then in 8th grade. There was this girl and a guy she liked. And i guess he liked me and rumor was that he was going to ask me out. He told me that I was one of the prettiest girls ever and a awesome artist in font of all most everyone! Including the girl. Then she came up to me and said, "" When you first came to this school, I was afraid you were the best artist but after our first art class, I wasn't so worried."" TO MY FACE!!! Then I just started to walk away but she grabbed my hair and yanked me to the ground. Then she raised her hand to punch me when my only friend pushed her out of the way and helped me up. My friend yelled at her, "" What is wrong with you!? You wouldn't like it if someone came up to and did that! "" My friend was the only person who outside of my family- I really loved. My friend was the boy who liked me. Now he's my boyfriend and will always stand up for me. He's someone who will believe in my before anyone else, or when no one else would. Kind of like my best friend but even more. He knows me and accepted me. He knows me better than anyone else. He makes me a better person. Wait, no he doesn't make me a better person I do that myself because he inspires me. I'll carry him with me forever. I'll always love him. And NOTHING can change that. It will be hard. it will hurt. it will require you to make better choices. there will be temptation. You need will power, it will require effort. there will be times when you want to give up. but once you reach your goal, i promise you, it is worth it."
Anonymous,"When I started school I wasn't liked much. People said I was ugly. That was in just kindergarten. When I went to 3rd grade it got worse. People called me fat, stupid, ugly, ect. Then in 5th and 6th grade people called me the b word and kept telling me I was h**. I didn't even do anything to be called those. I'm not fast at answering math questions so the kids would tease me and tell me that I should still be in 1st grade. One time a kid threw paper at me during our foods class. It said this ""You're a mistake. You're parents wish you were dead. Guys hate you. You go around school like a slut. You think you're so hot. But you're not. You're just a fat stupid idiot who should just die."" It really hurt my feelings and I started to believe it. One time I almost drank should just die."" It really hurt my feelings and I started to believe it. One time I almost drank when I was hanging out with friends. I went to go to the bathroom. Her bathroom has a cabinet with  and stuff in it. So I grabbed the bottle open the cap then My friend knocked on the door because I was taking so long. I told her I'd be out in a moment. She knew about the note and all the bullying cause she was in all my classes. There was a secret was to unlock The door and she was afraid that I was gonna try to commit suicide so she unlocked it and took away from me. She saved my life. Her and I went back to the room. We told the other girls about me trying to {edited} and the note. They told me I should tell my parents and the principal. I told my parents when I went home the next day and that Monday my parents took me to school and confronted the principal about it. The principal called about 19 or 20 kids to the office because of the bullying and calling me names and teasing me. The teachers were brought into this. And it stopped for a while. People still bully me but they don't do as severe things anymore. It's not bad to tell an adult. If you don't it could get as bad as my problem was. Tell an adult if you're getting bullied"
Laura,"Hi I'm Laura I met a girl in 7th grade, let's call her A, and we were fast friends. After a while, I lost a lot of my friends (two of them ran off with each other, some just ,moved on). But, she had a lot of other friends in our classes, so she would just hang out with me when none of the others were around. I didn't really mind, but then she started being friends with a girl, let's call her C. At lunch I sat with them (though I don't know why, I guess because I was a bit of a reject) and they would never include me. Sure, they'd ask me for some chocolate or sunflower seeds every now and then, but not much else. Whenever I tried to talk to her/them in the halls, A would just sideways glance at me and keep talking to C. The last straw was when we had 2 days of presentations. My display board was close to hers, so we had to stand next to each other a lot. When I tried to talk to her or squeeze into a convo by adding a comment, she would say ""Uh, I was talking to . Later, she asked if I could walk on my heels. I showed her I could, and she tried, but her heels were too skinny and her shoes were too strappy to walk on heels in them, so I said ""Your shoes are too fancy to walk on your heels in."" Apparently that got her riled up for some reason because all day she tried to get me back. She said her shoes were better than mine (my gramma gave me those shoes!), said my display board was boring because it was white and hers was amazing because it was purple, and criticized the way I presented my speech. When I asked other people, they didn't say the same things about it she did. In all this, I still had friends here and there. One girl, Damaris, would always sit by me in homeroom. My stand partner in orchestra and I were buddies, too. Always, always remember that if someone doesn't accept you, it's their loss. Never lose sight of the people who do care, those who matter. Know who's using you and who's a true friend. Stand up for yourself, because if I had I wouldn't have spent such a long time as a loner."
Kayla,"My name is kayla and ever since I started school I was bullied in the little school it was physical I was punched, kicked this happened everyday by a boy until one day one lad stuck up for me and hit him back when he saw what was going on.

Lexie,"My name is Lexie. I am a freshman in high school and have been bullied since elementary school. I have felt like I was all alone for as long as I can remember. My brother passed away when I was 11, I am 14 now. It has been a major struggle. I would burn myself as a way to release the pain. I had quit for a long time, but recently did it again. The day I burned myself was a bad day, I hadn't been bullied or anything, it was just a hard day. I was suicidal for a long time. I have tried to tell the bullies to leave me alone and eventually they did. I have a best friend who understands me when no one else does, her and my cousin who is my world essentially saved my life. It may be rainy now but eventually it gets better, it may not be today or tomorrow but it will! I am living, breathing proof! It will get better. Be proud of who you are and DO NOT let them get to you! Stay Strong! "
Nyquiah,"Hi, my name is Nyquiah. I have been teased all my life. I've been called everything from fat to ugly to worthless. But it wasn't until 10th grade that the teasing reach a new level. When I was in 10th grade, I switched schools. It was fine the first few months, but then I was befriended by this girl in my woodshop class. We were close, laughing and acting like best friends. Well, one day, she basically turned on me. Out of nowhere. She went and told her cousin and another one of their friends. It was horrible. I can't count the times I went to the guidance office. It got to the point where I couldn't even take the main hall to class. I had to take the breezeway (outside hallway). They followed me to class, said things about me, and everything else. I had class with one of the girls, her cousin ride my bus, and I had lunch with ALL THREE OF THEM. I don't care where I went, I always ran into one of them. I had always loved school, but I hated it at this point. My grades had dropped tremendously. I cried every morning and night. I would get on the bus and just keep my head down because one of the girls sat in the first seat and she always said something to me. There was this one girl... She was the worst one. She was a bit more outspoken and aggressive than they were. So she was the one who did the ""dirty work"". I had one 2 friends who stuck with me through it all. I'm so grateful for them. As for the girls, I don't know what happened to them. 2 of them graduated, and the other one quit school. I'm over it, but the memories and scars are still there. I might forget what they did, and I might forget what they said... But I will NEVER forget how they made me feel."
Zoe,"""It started in Year 7, which I think is like 6th Grade in America or something. There was this one boy; he was my tormentor, my intimidator and my oppressor. He considered me to be nothing more than a fat, ugly, mentally unstable child. I would go home, and I would cry myself to sleep every night without fail. He lived not to far away from me, and some nights he would follow me home. He would torment me and call me names the whole journey. I kept to myself about the bullying for SEVEN months. But by the time I finally opened up about it, I was already diagnosed clinically depressed and I was already diagnosed with Trichotillomania - which was triggered through the bullying. Trichotillomania is a form of self abuse, and basically where you pull out your own hair constantly and uncontrollably. You cant help it and it is very difficult to stop. So now, Im left eyelash-less, I dont have eyebrows, and I have bald patches in my hair. The worst thing is, it wont stop. There have been cases where people have stopped it, and there hair has grown back like the disorder never even existed in their lives. But me? No. That wont happen. Most of my hair wont grow back, and the hairs/eyebrow hairs/eyelashes that do grow back blonde (I have naturally dark brown hair). They wont grow back because I have damaged the hair follicles. The bald patches are so bad, that I have to put eye shadow in my hair that is the same colour as my natural hair colour, to cover it up. Even though its still noticeable. I have to draw my eyebrows on, but you can tell theyre drawn on so its still noticeable. I have to wear eyeliner to try and hide it, but still, from the side its noticeable. This only give people another reason to bully me and more people joined in with the torment because it was abnormal to them. Since Year 7 (6th Grade), Ive started cutting myself, burning myself, and starving myself. Im now 14, in Year 10 (9th Grade), and I am covered from head to toe in scars, Ive tried several times to end my life and I weigh just over 6 stone, which in proportion with my height and age is awfully underweight. Yet they still dont stop. Ive been having counselling and support from CAMHS (Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service) for almost 4 years now. Everyone knows, but not many care. The bullying has decreased now, but Im still left with the physical and mental scars. If youre being bullied, PLEASE speak out! You dont have to suffer alone x"""
Briley ,"My name is Briley and I'm 13 years old. I've been bullied ever since I could remember. Everyone at my school bullies me, I get called ""Midgit"" because I'm short. They bully me and call me names everyday. I had this one friend, who I actually thought was my friend until she started beating me. She hits me everywhere, she bullies me, she shoves me, and sometimes when I sit down she forces my head down to the seat. I haven't really told anybody yet because I'm afraid if I do she'll hit me even more !! And there used to be this one girl on my bus last year who would hit me and yank my hair, one time the bus had turned and I had fell out of my seat and onto the floor and she grabbed and handful of my hair and yanked me up off the ground and back into my seat. Her bullying had gotten worse over the next month. One day we were riding the bus when she claimed that I hit her with my umbrella (which I didn't) so she beat me with my umbrella, grabbed a fistful of my hair and kept yanking and pulling it while she called me a stupid. My bus driver never did anything about it. I called my mom crying me eyes out because of what that girl did. That was the day I decided I had finally had enough of her bullying. I filed a bully report against her and I almost got a restraining order on her too. I know my story isn't as bad as everyone else's on here but it's still a bullying story and its nice to get it all out "
Cheyanne,"Well ever since I've been in second grade I was bullied. In first grade, I believed I was friends with everyone, and everyone liked me. But when I got in second grade, there was this one girl, she always said thinks like, ""I so want to punch her in the face."" And it was always when i was sitting there. My friends started to turn against me, my closest friend left in second grade. In third grade she came back and was in my class. This one girl was her friend too, but she always tried to turn her away from me. In third grade I lost most of my friends, I was down to a few. I remember all the insults and the comments. I remember one of my old friends telling me the 'Sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me' thing, she tried to make me repeat it, but I was in tears, I couldn't repeat, because it wasn't true. These words hit me harder than what I ever thought they could. The years pasted and i lost more and more friends, but I met one girl who cared for me, she was always there for me. On my way to middle school I thought I could make new friends, but I didn't, I only gained more enemies, they never gave me the time of day. The girl I met in elementary school, though, she stood by my side, and still does. I met some friends and we hang out all the time. Even if I get insults my friends are still there, they will never ditch me. I got a threat once but my friends where there to see me through it, they said they would protect me no matter what. It gets better no matter how bad it is now."
Meghan,"My names meghan. And im 14 years old. All my life, I been bullied. Non-stop. 1st grade to 9th grade. On a saturday, I was sleeping in.

Im glad i didnt die, Because if i did, in wouldnt of got the chance to show everybody who i really am. "
Anonymous,"Hello this is my bullying story and its recently happening. It's not a major bullying problem but I thought people should know. Well ill be honest I did used to bully people. But I would be like hey shorty. Nothing too bad. And you might say this is karma. Well just last night I told my followers on instagram and twitter to ask me questions, on ask.fm . And these are the things I got (the bottom small font is my replies) I didn't know that people hated me. I cried on and off. And I talked to like two people about it. One said just ignore them. Like the usual person would say to someone in my situation. The other person said delete your account on ask.fm . But I thought maybe I shouldn't. Later that night I used the screenshots above and posted it on my instagram account . Gosh I love my followers on instagram. It couldn't have been any of them, they treat me like a goddess. The comments were amazing. They said things like "" oh don't listen to them."" "" that's why they're anonymous and they can't say it to your face"" and they even went on my ask and said nice things like I'm perfect and I'm amazing. But I don't believe it they scared me. I know it's not that bad of a bully story but I thought people should know. If anybody ever reads or listen to what I have to say . Well thanks anyway for reading this"
Ashley,"here is my story. im Ashley i was just in first grade like most people minding my own business when this group of people boys and girls. they have surrounded me and they started to push me around the group. i started to cry then they stopped. one of the girls started to call me names. i moved schools. the bullying started happening in 7th grade. these girls would follow me into the bathroom and call me names and hit me. i was so scared because i didn't know what they were going to do. so they started to kick me and hit me harder. i was still scared. so a teacher walked in the stop it. she heard me screaming. all i wanted to do was lay there and die. they had got suspended and i was hoping it would stop. i was walking home one day and the girl had followed me home. they pulled me in an alley and beat me up so bad i was in the hospital with broken ribs and a broken nose. i was scared that they was going to do it again. in 8th grade was bad to. i was beat up almost everyday. i was called alot of names [edited] etc. i was so hurt. i was starting to cut myself again. i couldn't handle it. i was so scared. 8th grade was my worst year. last year, the same girls beat me up again and called me names. i wanted to die. i thought about it but i didnt want to. im in 10th grade now, most of the bullying have stopped. im at a new school now. im am still getting made fun of though. But not as bad as it was. I still scared that one day im going to get jumped. That's my story. You should tell yours."
Kady,"It started when i was 11 in middle school. Every day when i would get on the bus in the afternoon the 8th and 7th graders were always making rude comments to me. [edited] It just wasnt fair. I NEVER told anyone my story except 2 of my best friends. They were with me threw the past couple of years. They said why i wouldnt tell a teacher, Guidance, Or a trusted adult. I mean it was 2 much nobody knew what i was going threw. One day that girl that called me [edited] I went into the woods and started to cut right their i just wanted my life to be over until matt called and he helped me work everything out. My torture began when, in 8th grade, my parents chose to put me in a Christian school after being home schooled all my life, It didn't take long after the first day that the girls started treating me poorly. Whenever we would have a break in between periods, they would call me out publicly for what I was wearing or how my hair looked. ""Why are you wearing grandma clothes?"" and ""What did you do to your hair? Burn it?"" were comments I became immune to. Then it was my body type they started picking apart. At 19, I still only weigh 107 pounds so I'm naturally petite. They started calling [edited] and calling me anorexic. I would go home every day and cry till i couldn't cry anymore. Then, as if it couldn't get any worse, my parents began the process of a divorce. [edited] It was then that I fell into depression. I even tried taking my own life by trying to choke myself with a belt. I became frustrated that it didn't work. I just wanted to die. My dad quickly removed me from the school and the two boys that had made the [edited] comment weren't even suspended or expelled. They were only made to apologize which they did with a smirk on their faces. I never went back to that place again nor did I ever speak to the kids who put me through all the pain. I ended up moving to a completely different state and started over. But only to get bullied once more by my ex boyfriend and his new girlfriend. They would tell everybody that I was a liar how I had supposedly cheated on my former boyfriend, bad mouthing me to everyone, and even trying to get me in trouble with my own dad and school officials for things I didn't even do. It ended up on one of my last weeks of my senior year they both waited for me to walk up the hill to my car after school and my ex boyfriend grabbed me on my upper arms, shook me, and yelled at me, while his girlfriend also was yelling at me for things I also had not done. The principle overlooked the matter and no disciplinary action took place. Now I'm in college, and I've tried to move past everything and become a better person in my own life. If I can live through all of that, so can you. I pray every day for those bullies that tried to hurt me. Because in the end, they're only hurting themselves. "
Destiny,Im Destiny When I was around 10/11do to a little family issues I had to live with my dad for a month I had to go to school still so the schools were different from Hollywood the kids would call me names and treat me bad cause I came from and was born in Hollywood. I didn't know why they were being so mean so every day I would come home crying not knowing why no one wanted to be friends with me And no one would really give me a chance to actually see that I'm just like them and there nothing really different. Now I'm 18 iv learned to never treat a person bad and always get to see who they are and not just judge by we're they come from or look like. Iv also learned yo stand up for my self and be the bigger person in a bullying situation and to help anyone in that kind of situation. No person on earth deserves to be bullied no matter what it's not right.
Victoria,"Hi my name is victoria, When I was in year 3 I got bullied for my skin colour. I had 1 best friend called darcey but eventually turned on me to go on my bully side I ignored it everyday.

Karissa,"My name is Karissa.I am currently 17 years old and a Junior in High School. From the beginning, I knew I would be a different kind of girl when I entered high school. I wanted to be a different person from what I was in middle school. It all began my freshman year, I was bullied relentlessly and teased constantly. I was pushed into lockers, pushed down in the hallways, made fun of by nasty comments from people who walked past me. I would also get dirty looks from different people in class. It got worse my Sophomore year. Then now as a junior, I have attempted suicide and I was cutting for about 3 years. I never thought I would end up this way. It wasn't until my boyfriend Blake made me see the true meaning of life. He has helped me defeat the bullies and made me a stronger person. Am I still bullied today? Of course. But I don't let it bother me. I thank god everyday that I didn't decide to kill myself and now I have stopped cutting."
Lizzy,"My name is Lizzy. I've been bullied since kindergarten. Relentless teasing, pushing, punching. I was afraid to tell anyone, afraid that it would get worse. I knew adults saw, but they refused to acknowledge that those students were doing what they were to me. I was terrified to go to school, terrified of walking home... it was awful. I'm proud to say that for the last year I've been bully free, and I've started to speak against any bullies I see. I've made it my mission to raise awareness and to help those going through what I did. So kids, fight back. Don't give up. Remember, just because they don't see you as a wonderful person doesn't mean you aren't one. That is your choice."

Shyanne,"In the fifth grade (I was 10 years old at the time) I had a bully.He just started physically bullying me for no reason. He would ram his leg into my knee and pull my hair and push me up against the cubbies(little elementary school lockers) It was at the same time everyday, 2:30. I was always terrified, sometimes I didnt want to come to school. I had a bruise for a whole year on my leg the size of a volleyball! In sixth grade the 8th graders started pushing my books to the ground and pushing me into my locker, along with the knee ramming and the hair pulling from my other bully. I felt like I didnt fit in until an 8th grader saw what people were doing to me and confronted them about it. I remember: ""Stop! Just Stop bullying this girl. She doesnt deserve it! What if someone did that to you? Now go before I tell the principal."" He helped me up. ""Are you okay?"" He asked. ""Yeah, I'll be fine."" I said. Him and I (even though he is in high school now) are very good friends. We keep in touch. he took me to the principal's office to tell an adult. He knew exactly who those kids are. That boy is a life saver! If it weren't for him I would've probably gotten it even worse."
Skylar,"When I was about in the 2nd grade it seemed to start. I was sitting in class one day and these girls walk up to me and say, "" why are you sitting alone? "" I just tell them that hardly anyone wants to hang out with me. They start laughing and say mean things about me, which made me cry. Later on in 3rd grade those same girls told everyone not to hang out with me, I only had about 1 or 2 friends at the time, and it hurt. In 4th grade those girls acted a little nicer, but we're still rude. Even though I transferred they still make fun of me by calling me ugly,fat, annoying, and slow. I got really mad at that and I just snapped at them, but realized I became the bully. I learned that you really shouldn't listen to the people who hate you and just be yourself. Who cares if they don't like you for you, it's just how you act!"
Jasmine,"Hello! My name is Jasmine. I like your website. I have never been bullied once because I go to a private school where bullying in NOT encouraged.. Well, actually... I was bullied once. I was friends with a girl named Natalie when I was about 9 and she had a older sister who absolutely hated me. We had the same lunch times and she would always say stuff like, ""Your not good for my sister."" or, ""My sister doesnt even like you. It hurt a lot. Natalie was one of my best friends. I was one of her only friends because the other students werent adjusted to her yet. I was actually the first person who walked up to her on the first day of school that year. Anyway. Natalie repeatedly went to the counselor and Natalie, her sister, and I all went in once. This was halfway through the year and I couldnt take it anymore. The counselor sat us down and asked Natalies sister why she liked bullying me so much. She replied with, I dont know.. I didnt believe that, and the counselor didnt either. She asked her again and she replied with, Because I dont want my sister to have friends! That hurt me, a lot. After that Natalies sister wouldnt look me in the eyes again. The bullying stopped. I was a much happier kid. Natalie left the school to go to public school two years later but I still see her and keep in touch. Now I know to seek the counselor if something like that happened again."
Amanda,"Hi. My name is Amanda. This story is not about me, but about my friend, David. Him and I would be babysat together when I was four. Since my mom worked nearby where they lived, she would let me stay there. After a while, David and I soon forgot about each other, and moved on with our lives. Little did I know horrible things were happening to him.After eight years, at a doctor's appointment, my mother asked me a question that would stay in my heart forever."" Do you want to go to a funeral on Saturday?"" I looked at her funny, and replied,"" For one of your friends?"" She looked at me sad and replied, "" For yours."" I was shocked."" Which friend?"" I asked."" David."" At first, I had no clue who she was talking about. After showing me a picture of us together, it all started coming back. I asked her how he died.David was bullied at school by many people. Everyone knew, including some staff, but didn't do anything. Even worse, at home, he was beaten physically be his father. Still, the mother didn't do anything. I only wish I could've been there to help him through. Sadly, on Valentine's Day, David took his life by hanging himself. All I hope is that the people who read this, don't stand by, knowing someone is getting hurt constantly, because you could be the difference between life and death."
Megan,i have two stories i wanted to share with your website. first was about a boy named ezra in my seventh grade history class. he was pretty immature and always acting kinda weird. whenever he talked someone would scream to shut up. or say really mean things. 'go die in a hole!' ' no one likes you!' and now i regret that i would never stand up to the other kids. also there was a time when i was bullied. one year in middle school a girl named Kendell gutner bullied me. i ended up going out with a boy she had once dated and still liked. she when around saying really bad stuff about me and spreading rumors. she would text the boy how she was going to kill me and how i was not good enough. one day my art teacher heard me talking about this to one of my friends and told the guidance counselor. we had a talk and i lied and said that i was exaggerating. i didn't want to cause more trouble. the next year we actually became friends. but i just think that that shows how anyone can do it. even those who seem to be the nicest of people. p.s my name is megan.
Anonymous,"When I was in first grade, I went to school with my best friend. We would always be together at all times no matter what and we were like two peas in a pot. Until I reached second grade. My friend and I were still very close, until a new girl came into the picture. She started telling me rude things to me. I tried to ignore her, but each day it got worse and worse and it brought me down. I started to feel less confident about myself each day from her mean and cruel words. To make things worse, she stole my best friend. The friend who I trusted all the time, but I tried to move on. Soon, my ""old friend"" started calling me mean things back to me along with the other mean girl. I tried to ignore them, but it was useless. I would cry when I went home, and I would convince my mom into homeschooling me everyday. Finally, she home schooled me. I was home schooled for about 5 years or so, and throughout those years, I've had 2 friends who backstabbed me and betrayed me. It hurt me, but I got through it because I knew they weren't worth it. When I reached 7th grade, I was feeling lonely being at home and I decided I wanted to go back to school. My mom put me into school in the middle of the year, which made things very awkward for me. The first week of starting school, it felt weird because I had started in the middle of the semester and I didn't really know anyone. People would look at me like I was an alien. There was a group of mean/popular girls that would tease me for little reasons. It made me feel insecure about myself. The school that I attended was a private school, so the kids were very snotty and rich, and they would think that they're all that. And also, there is alot of bullying going in that school, and I know a kid who tried to commit suicide from the harsh words some kids would tell him. I told my mom how I felt, and she told me that I should stand up to myself and tell them how I felt. I was scared to stand up for myself, (I'm a very shy person) but I realized the more I ignored them, the worse it gets. So I spoke up. But I didn't tell them alone, I had others who had been dealing with the same thing. We told them to stop bullying us because it bothered us. We told them that it affected us and that they should not continue to do this to us or anyone else. Finally, the teasing stopped. I met new and loyal friends that made me feel confident about myself, and I learned that no matter what a bully tells you, you shouldn't ignore it and brush it off. Never suffer in silence. Speak up, tell a parent or a friend, don't deal with him/her alone. Also, be confident in yourself, you're beautiful, no matter what."
Anonymous,"When I was in about fourth grade, it was my first time I ever got bullied. A girl came up to me and out of nowhere just said ""You're stupid and ugly. You don't even belong at this school."". That's where it all began. That was pretty much the only time in fourth grade I got bullied. Now, lets move on to fifth grade. That's where the big floods of bullying came. People came up to me almost daily calling me ugly. I used to wear a lot of makeup because I, also, believed I was ugly, and because of that, a girl would always call me ugly and stupid for piling tons of makeup on my face. People would call me ugly all of the time, and also, sometimes they would call me fat. Then in sixth grade, it sort of died down a little, because I didn't wear as much makeup. And last year, in seventh grade, this boy would call me ugly all the time and tell me every day I was annoying, when I didn't even talk to him at all. When I didn't hear about him saying rude things about me, he'd be behind my back talking about me. He got a lot of his friends to go after me and call me ugly. I've also been called emo and gothic because of the music I listen to and the way that I sometimes dress. I haven't yet really told an adult, but I know that I should. I've told many friends, one being one of my bully's cousins. I've also had bullies in kindergarten who would throw rocks at me and at my bike tires when I would be riding my bike. One of them recently passed away, so R.I.P to him, and I've also recently met up with one of them, who sincerely apologized for it. Another time I was bullied, someone threw a baseball at my leg and left a big, round welt, and twisted one of my friends' thumbs and made her bleed. I've also been bullied by being swung around by my hair and thrown to the ground.I'm going to be telling an adult the next time I'm bullied. I just thought this was a much easier way to get it out for now. Thank you for listening to my story."
Hannah,"When I was in Year 4 (3rd Grade), I joined a new school, everyone instantly became my friend, and I had grown an interest in a particular boy I sat next to. In Year 7 (6th Grade), I still liked him, and in Year 5 (4th Grade), I had told my friend about it; we fell out in Year 6 (5th Grade). In Year 7, she had told everyone, even the boy himself, and it caused me to cry even more and more than usual. But then things got personal; she started bullying my best friend, Sara, and I had to stick up for her. I went up to the bully and punched her in the face. What else were I to do? She got up tried punching me, but I stopped her and kneed her in the gut. She had done so too, in previous years, and hit me a lot, so I had to stick up for myself. She then said ""What do you think you're doing?"" So I responded, as of her flat nose, ""Sorry, did I hurt you, Voldemort?"" And everyone around me applauded me, I felt proud. A couple of days later, I had been called to the headteacher's office, and got a detention for kneeing her. She never let me explain what happened. The point is, it's good to stick up for yourself, but maybe do it verbally, not physically; and it's also better to tell someone about your situation before the fighting and standing up for yourself. I needed to protect my best friend, any good friend would, but I should have told a teacher or authoritative adult."
Anonymous,"When I was in 7th grade I was about to move but in a few months and i got along really well with a lot of people. But when people found out they started whispering behind my back, I didn't notice at first but then i heard a few guys whom I thought were my friends saying they were glad i was moving. . . It really hurt and i didn't know what to do so I started cutting and when my friends found out they told the guidance counselor who told my parents. But the thing is my parents didn't care they told me to stop faking, and the fact that my parents didn't believe me is what made me suicidal. Nothing really helped until I moved and I wasn't bullied anymore but my parents still don't care and that bothers me but I'm no longer thinking that way or cutting."
Sarah,"When I was 10 years old, I was a huge fan of a website. I always went on it everyday. I had 4 guys as my best friends on there. One of the four started saying mean things to me. He called me a Boy a gold digger. Even more things That were a bit inappropriate. And more. He even said things like ""If you suicide, I would be very happy."" ""Go to hell"" ""I bet you are actually A Boy"". I had no one there to help me. The boy was no longer my best friend. My 3 other best friends wouldn't help me. They were his friend too. A few weeks later. One of my 3 best friends Became the bully too. He said things like ""I hate her!"" ""She's ugly"" ""You have fat cheeks"" (He saw my face in real). The 2 boys threatened to Tell on my parents. A month later, I found out One of my 2 best friends was with the first bully. I realized I only had one Best friend there for me, But some of the time he would not do much. I did my best to keep from feeling depressed Like Calling ""Kids Help Phone"" But they wouldn't help much, Saying just to ignore. I felt depressed, And alone. I lost my 3 best friends. I stood up for myself, But I still felt depressed. 'Hate is Only Love Hiding In The Shadows, Afraid to come out."
Anonymous,"I've been bullied for over six years now and it still goes on, it never seems to stop. It started when my Dad left when I was six, I told one friend and she back-stabbed me and told everybody, the next day people were making fun of me and laughing at me, and making jokes. I didn't tell my parents, the guidance counselor... I.Told.NOBODY. I went through third grade and fourth grade with only my two best guy friends, my Dad had had over three different girlfriends in the past two years. My Dad always wanted the best for me and my sister I think but I don't think he ever could get the best for us. My little sister was about one when he had started dating this one girl, my Dad and her fought non-stop, there would always be throwing, hitting, screaming, and blood, the police always showed up. After they had broke up, my Dad found some new girl and they ended up getting married after ONE FREAKING MONTH. To be honest I don't like my stepmom, she makes me feel like Im worthless, stupid, ugly, broken, hideous, and lots of others.. the thing is my Dad didn't tell me he got married until two weeks after the wedding. I was so frustrated I thought my only way out of all my stress and depression was cutting and suicide. My Dad and stepmom are still together today, my sister is five now and is a beautiful young lady and she's always happy, and is just perfect.. but me on the other hand my mom always yells at me everyday, she threatens to hit me, and put me in a foster home, and she calls me all these names that hurt me. I started fifth grade and made one friend that was a girl, I was happy but then I got a little too happy and told about my cutting and attempts, and depression, she turned on me. People at school started hitting me and grabbing my wrists and ankles looking for scars, cuts, burns, etc. They never found any. I started walking to school because people on the bus used to hit me, dump my bag out, and do mean things to me. I started cutting myself more and more until my thighs, and wrists where shredded. My parents never noticed, they didn't care. I tried hanging myself in my front yard in June because I couldn't stand the bullying anymore and all the stress I was going through. It turns out the person who saved me was the person that bullied me the most, the guy that used to bully me is now my best friend and saviour. Yes I still do cut but I have cut back A LOT, and im very proud of myself. I stand up for myself more now. I have more friends that are willing to stand up for me. Words Of Advice, Don't do what I did, it was stupid and it led to very bad things. Speak Up, Tell An Adult. If someone is bullying you tell somebody, get help, TELL SOMEBODY. You're Important.<3 And many people will miss you if you were to leave. "
Anonymous,"It started when I was 11. I just moved schools. Everything was alright, I even made a few friends. A few months later, the school decided to make a completely new class in order to make the classes smaller (because apparently that helps with learning and eliminates bullying; Yeah, right!). I was chosen to be moved from my old class to the new one. At first it was fine, everyone ignored me, and I was happy to be left alone. Then it started. One day after school a few people from my new class came to me. ""Hi"" a girl said ""Wanna be friends?"" I said ""Yes"" of course. She laughed and told me that she's sorry but her and her mates can't be friends with 'emo loners' like me. A few more situations like that followed, but soon it turned physical. For a few weeks I was beaten up almost everyday after school. When I told the teacher, she said I can't move classes and that's final. So I was stuck with those horrible people. I started cutting myself, and cried myself to sleep every night. But after a few more months of putting up with that, I decided to tell my family. They didn't do anything at first, but after a while got tired of me moaning about how I hate school and talked to the head teacher. A week or so after that I was moved to another class and avoided my bullies during break. They soon forgot about me. I'm perfectly fine now. I stopped cutting. I hardly ever cry. And all because I told someone who could actually do so something."
Arianna,"When I when I was in 3rd grade, I started getting bullied. I was called shortie. I was bullied, kicked, punched and laughed at. I didn't do anything back. I didn't want to get in trouble, so I just told my mother. She told the principal to stop this child from hurting me. But, I was still bullied and had to got to another school. Now I am 6th grade, trying to stand strong. I don't cut, but I was close to trying to hurt myself in another way. But I decided not too. I am still a victim of being bullied, but I'm stronger."
Becky ,"One time when I was in the car with my mom and sister, all the kids from school were coming out. We were just getting out of the school zone, when there was two boys walking on the sidewalk. All of a sudden, the one boy just pushed the other into the road. My mom beeped and had to step on the brakes to avoid an accident. Since I was in the car, I couldn't do much but I was so shocked that kids would push other kids into busy traffic. Bullying is a very big problem, and I think it should end. I hope they enforce laws that it won't be tolerated if you're caught in action."
Anonymous,"Since I was about 9, (i'm 12 now) I have been bullied at school. People call me fat and ugly. They laugh at me, threaten to beat me. Every time I told a teacher, they told me to go to the guidance counselor. When I go, she tells me to ignore them. Anyone who's been bullied, knows that's quite hard. Just recently in 6th grade, it got more serious. I started thinking about suicide and cutting. My friends told all our teachers, and finally they did something. Bullying has decreased for me. So, the point is, don't be afraid to tell someone. Friends, teachers, neighbors, parents, siblings, anyone. They WILL help. Just tell them. It'll work eventually."
Deb,"Bullying is something that's been around forever. Too often, people shrug it off as ""a part of growing up"". But the consequences can be a devastating experience for the recipient. I can remember back to my own childhood, there was a girl in my neighborhood that would often be taunted with cruel jokes. As kids, we would all just stand by and laugh. Though seeming harmless at the time, I am embarrassed to admit, I myself, had sometimes been laughing at the expense of that girl. In later years as an early teen, I also had a turn at a bullying experience. Now I felt exactly what it was like to feel hurt, scared and doubting my own self worth. Just like that girl from my neighborhood a few years earlier. Unfortunately,this problem continues to fly under the radar. It effects all races, genders and religions. I love the idea of kids banning together and helping end these problems. This is a harsh but necessary issue that effects us all. As a parent, I urge us all to talk to our kids about the facts. Don't ignore it or be afraid to face it. Reach out and help stop the hate."
Lizzie,"When I was younger, being on stage was something I enjoyed. When my mom told me that there was a play and tryouts were the upcoming week, I was extremely excited. My mom drove me over to the tryouts, and I saw that there were lots of kids who wanted to be in the play. When they told me I made it I was full of joy. I couldn't stop thinking how much fun this would be. On the first day I realized there were a group of four girls, and the ""leader"" of it was this one girl, we can call her T. At first 'T' seemed kinda nice, but then things suddenly turned around. She started making up lies, rumors and calling me names which made me cry. They took all my joy away from me. There was a girl who couldn't stand this bully. She and I promised each other that we would tell the director about this problem. When I was looking for her, she was making fun of me secretly with the mean girls. I tried to tell the director, but all he said was ""kids will be kids, just ignore them."" I had to tell a parent who listened, and they helped. You know the saying ""sticks and stone may break my bones, but names will never hurt me""? People say that, but the words are the ones that can hurt the most. I learned that bullies will just try to break you down and make you feel bad about yourself, but they're just doing that to make themselves feel better. Bullying is NEVER good in any way. Even to this day, I'm still slightly bullied. Every now and then someone will try to tear my spirit apart... but I know that you should just ignore it because after a while they'll just give up. If you're a bully, just think how the other person might feel. And if you're a victim, just tell someone that can help."
